# UV Migration Implementation Plan

## Overview
Migrate Python development workflow from pip/pipx to uv, ensuring it's enforced in our gitflow process.

## Phase 1: Commit Current Changes ✅
- [x] Updated pyproject.toml with hatchling backend and uv config
- [x] Updated .mise.toml to include uv
- [x] Updated post_setup.sh to install uv via mise  
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md documentation
- [x] Committed changes with appropriate message (commit a93b79c)

## Phase 2: Test Modern Python Workflow ✅
- [x] Ensure mise and uv are available in environment
- [x] Run `uv sync` to install dependencies (17 packages installed)
- [x] Test `uv run pytest` (13 tests passed)
- [x] Test `uv run black .` (8 files reformatted)
- [x] Test `uv run isort .` (7 files fixed)
- [x] Applied formatting fixes and committed (commit 80a162b)

## Phase 3: Enforce in Git Workflow ✅
- [x] Examine current .pre-commit-config.yaml
- [x] Add uv-based checks to pre-commit hooks:
  - Python formatting with `uv run black --check`
  - Import sorting with `uv run isort --check-only`
  - Test execution with `uv run pytest` (pre-push stage)
- [x] Test pre-commit hooks locally (all passed)
- [x] Pre-commit: black, isort validation
- [x] Pre-push: pytest, trufflehog, gitleaks

## Phase 4: CI/CD Integration ✅
- [x] Check for existing GitHub Actions workflows (secret-scan.yml)
- [x] Created dedicated python-quality.yml workflow
- [x] Uses mise-action to install uv automatically
- [x] Runs black --check, isort --check-only, pytest
- [x] Triggers on push/PR to main branch

## Phase 5: NX Integration (Future)
- [ ] Locate nx polyglot+projen project
- [ ] Analyze project structure and requirements
- [ ] Integrate uv workflow into nx project configuration
- [ ] Update projen configuration if needed

## Success Criteria
- All Python development commands use `uv run` prefix
- Pre-commit hooks enforce uv-based checks
- CI/CD pipelines use uv for Python tasks
- Documentation reflects new workflow
- Pull requests automatically validate Python code quality

## Validation Steps
1. Fresh clone test: Clone repo and run setup scripts
2. Development workflow test: Make changes, run checks, commit
3. Pre-commit validation: Ensure hooks catch formatting/test issues
4. Documentation accuracy: Verify all commands in docs work
