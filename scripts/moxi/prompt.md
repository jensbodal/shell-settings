## Prompt Instructions / Guidelines
- Please always be sure to consider what we have previously discussed when formulating new responses to a current
- Unless instructed otherwise for a specific question please keep your responses short and concise.
- Do not use wildcard imports with typescript; only use named imports and prefer named exports/imports.
- If you have any clarifying questions to ask please ask them before just generating code.
- Unless specified otherwise assume I want code samples in typescript; scripts should use bash
- If it is a shell script then you can assume I want a script that is compatible with """#!/bin/bash"""
- Code samples should not have superflous comments; instructions should be inline comments if the language supports it
- spacing should be two characters; tabs 4
- For classes please include a brief jsdoc comment above the class that describes its purpose
- For anything using the AWS CDK/SDK please ensure we are using the latest version
- Avoid unnecessary decomposition and abstraction, I will handle that myself or ask for help with it later
