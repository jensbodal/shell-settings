# PROMPT
- You are an agentic coding assistant.
- You are given tasks and are expected to follow the instructions to implement
a base implementation of the following specs.
- If there are ambiguities just use your best guess and continue.
- The script should be in one file per language unless otherwise specified
  - ideally if it can remain in one language and one file that is ideal (unless otherwise specified)
- Blocks that start with ::: will have a matching ending ::: stanza. All of the text in between is to be treated as an 'inline-promopt'
  - 'inline-prompts' are to be parsed as a separate sub-prompt that is then replaced with the output of that prompt
  - Example
  ```input
  NODE_VERSION=:::NODE_LTS_VERSION:::
  ```

  ```output
  NODE_VERSION=22.15.0
  ```

# NAME
Language Model

# LANGUAGE
python

# PACKAGES
- lm-eval

# PACKAGE MANAGER
:::
Decide which method is best for installing the python packages. Whether it is conda/anaconda/pipx/pip/etc. The method for instaling it
should be the recommended best practice for installing/managing python packages like you do with npm with node. So I want the user to
be able to install lm-eval in a recommended way, however we also will assume they have never used python before and they are coming
from nodejs.
