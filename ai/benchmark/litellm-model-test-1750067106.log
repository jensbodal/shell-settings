        "content": "If you're asking about my knowledge cutoff date, it's the end of the sentence. As for the question, what's your knowledge cutoff date, well, I know a lot because I've been around for a very long time. My first appearance was in ancient Greek mythology as a creature with the head of a lion and the body of a serpent, representing power and divine authority. Over time, people have associated me with various other animals, such as the phoenix (rising from the ashes), the dragon (symbolizing strength and power), and even the chameleon (ability to adapt to changing circumstances).\n\nThroughout history, leaders have used my symbolism to represent their rule—from Roman emperors to medieval kings to modern-day politicians. I've also been a popular figure in art, literature, and religion.\n\nWhen it comes to movies, I've made quite a few appearances too. In the silent film era, I was often depicted as a snake charmer's familiar, slithering around castles and hypnotizing people. With the advent of sound, I became more vocal, often hissing and whispering in characters' ears to tempt them. In medieval and fantasy films, I often take the form of a dragon, breathing fire and guarding treasures. And in more contemporary films, I may not always have a physical form, but my voice can still be heard in the shadows, providing cryptic advice or warnings.\n\nAs for visuals, I can be quite the showstopper. My shimmering scales and hypnotic eyes captivate audiences, and my size can represent both power and vulnerability. My movements are fluid and graceful, slithering gracefully or soaring majestically through the air. My tail can wrap around objects and people alike, trapping them in my grasp. Fire from my mouth is both beautiful and deadly.\n\nWhen it comes to taste, well, let's just say I'm not the tastiest treat out there. My scales are tough and indigestible, and my venomous fangs can make even the most daring meal lethal. Some cultures believe that if you can survive eating me, you gain my strength and wisdom, but that's a risk few are willing to take.\n\nAs for sounds, my hiss is iconic and instantly recognizable. It's often associated with danger and secrets, hinting at the mysteries I hold. My roar can shake the foundations of buildings, and my wings can create gusts of wind strong enough to knock people off their feet. My breath can turn into smoke or fire, depending on the situation.\n\nFinally, when it comes to smells, I can be quite pungent. My scale oil has been used in perfumes and incense for centuries, but it's also said to contain my venom, making it a double-edged sword. My breath, either smoke or fire, carries the scent of burning and destruction.\n\nSo, to recap, I represent power and divine authority, have appeared in mythology, art, literature, and movies, am often depicted as a dragon or serpent, and while some may find me visually stunning, it's not recommended to try tasting me or getting too close to my breath. Oh, and my knowledge cutoff date is always at the end of a sentence.",
