⠙ ⠙ Choosing the best containerized environment for running a dedicated application on Proxmox can vary based on your specific needs and preferences, especially when considering compatibility with macOS while also providing strong performance across Linux or Windows environments. Here's what I would recommend:

For Docker-based solutions (which are commonly used in such cases due to their widespinning popularity), you might look into the following options that can handle 3D printing slicer configurations well, with a focus on macOS compatibility where possible and good performance across Linux or Windows systems.

1. **Proxmox Container OS**: You're using Proxmox as your infrastructure provider, so you already have an edge here because of its Docker-based container management capabilities which are well supported by many remote desktop tools capable of running macOS applications via Wine compatibility layers or virtualization when needed.
   
2. **Parallels Desktop for Mac**: This is a native application to run Windows on your Mac, but it can also be configured to connect with Proxmox VMs hosting Linux environments and access Docker containers within them through VNC (Virtual Network Computing) or similar protocols that allow you the flexibility of running macOS-based applications.
   
3. **Parallels Desktop for Windows**: If working on a Mac is not strictly necessary, Parallels can also run Linux environments and Docker containers which could host your 3D printing slicer directly if it's compatible with Linux or via Wine compatibility layers to provide macOS-like performance in some cases.
   
4. **VirtualBox**: You can create a Virtual Machine on Proxmox using VMware ESXi as the hypervisor, which supports various operating systems like Windows and is known for good 3D graphics capabilities necessary for slicing software; though macOS compatibility may require additional measures such as running Parallels inside this VM.
   
5. **Wine**: Wine can run many Mac applications on Linux or Unix-like environments, but its performance with resource-intensive tasks like 3D printing slicer configuration might not be optimal without specific tweaking and optimization of both the software's settings and configurations to suit non-native platforms.
   
6. **Remote Desktop Applications**: You can connect directly from your local machine (Windows, macOS or Linux) to a remote desktop session running inside any Docker container on Proxmox using tools like Microsoft Remote Desktop for Windows/macOS combo with additional compatibility layers if needed via Wine, or through VNC servers that are accessible remotely.
   
7. **Containerization of the Slicing Software**: If possible and applicable to your workflow design software's specific case (some slicers might be container-native), you could potentially run them directly inside Docker containers on Proxmox without much fuss, provided they are compatible with Linux environments or have good support for Wine under Windows.

Given these options, if the primary goal is to avoid configuration sync and centralize workflows in a local remote desktop setting while running macOS-like experience when possible: 

**Parallels Desktop on Mac (for native macOS compatibility) combined with Remote Access via VNC or Microsoft Teams/Skype for Mac into Proxmox VM hosting Linux Docker containers seems to be the ideal setup. You can deploy a highly optimized virtual machine within your local infrastructure using tools such as VirtualBox, which will run on top of Parallels Desktop and host Windows-based 3D printing slicer software through Wine compatibility layers if necessary**

This approach keeps configurations centralized to the Proxmox VM while providing access from any platform that can interact with VNC or Microsoft Teams/Skype for Mac. It also allows you to maintain an optimized macOS experience on your local machine via Parallels when working directly within a remote session, ensuring better performance where applicable without having direct sync issues across machines as the configurations are stored and managed locally inside Proxmox VMs in Docker containers or VirtualBox virtualized environments.

To ensure this setup works best for you:
- Install an optimized Linux distribution on your local machine with Parallels Desktop (macOS). 
- Set up a dedicated VM within the same infrastructure using tools like VirtualBox and deploy Windows/Linux docker containers as needed, ensuring Wine compatibility if running macOS applications.
- Use VNC or Microsoft Teams for Mac to connect from your local machine directly into Proxmox's remote desktop session where Docker is deployed with 3D printing slicer software installed either natively in Linux VM/Container OS on Proxmox, Wine compatibility layer inside a Windows container if macOS-based application must run via Parallels or VNC.

Remember to keep an eye on resource usage and tweak settings as appropriate for each method's performance characteristics when running high computational tasks like 3D printing slicing software in such environments, especially considering the potential bottl0necks of Wine compatibility layers if used outside Docker containers or Parallels.
