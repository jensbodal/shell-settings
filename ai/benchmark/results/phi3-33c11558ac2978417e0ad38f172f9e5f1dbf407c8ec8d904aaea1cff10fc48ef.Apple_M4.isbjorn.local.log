⠙ ⠙ Considering your requirements and constraints, I would recommend using Parallels Desktop Vision for Mac as it provides an excellent containerized experience with robust support for macOS applications like Blender or any other suitable 3D modeling software you might have in mind that does not natively run on Linux. It offers seamless integration of virtual machines (VMs) into the host'energizing your Proxmox environment, allowing dedicated resources and isolation similar to a local desktop experience without actually running macOS directly inside VMware guests or Hyper-V containers which are commonly found in Windows environments for remote access.

Here is why Parallels Desktop Vision might be suitable:

1. **Mac Integration**: Since you're aiming to run workflows on Mac but would also consider Linux and Windows, having a macOS host with the capability of running VMs provides continuity across different operating systems without needing direct installation or emulation within each guest OS in Proxmox.

2. **Remote Desktop Access**: Parallels offers VPN services that could be integrated into your workflow for secure access to resources on-demand, although this would require a separate setup not directly tied with the containerized desktop environment of either MacOS or Windows hosts. You may need additional configuration here as Proxmox itself doesn't natively support remote Desktop protocols without an intermediary like VNC (Virtual Network Computing).

3. **Persistence**: With Parallels, your settings and configurations are stored locally on the host machine rather than syncing between machines or being tied to a specific VM instance in Proxmox'es Linux hosts via containers such as Docker Swarm/Kubernetes where that capability is limited by default without additional setup.

4. **Resource Allocation**: Parallels Desktop allows you to dedicate resources (CPU, GPU) on your Mac host specifically for the VMs in which you're running workflow-related tasks like 3D printing slicer configuration or modeling software directly benefiting from macOS performance characteristics when required.

However, if Parallels is not an option due to licensing costs and given that Proxmox primarily runs Linux environments where VMware guests are commonly used with XenServer for similar purposes: 

**VMware Fusion or VirtualBox on Mac** can be considered as alternatives providing a macOS-like experience. These solutions support HOST_TO_GUEST networking which you could leverage in your workflow to maintain configurations localized within the host, avoiding sync issues across machines and leveraging Proxmox's robust container capabilities effectively when working on Linux hosts directly inside VMware guests or VirtualBox containers.

Here are additional steps if using a Mac with Parallels Desktop Vision:
- Ensure your macOS version is compatible with the virtual machine software you intend to use in Parallels for 3D modeling tasks (Blender, etc.). Some modern versions may not support older VM configurations without updates or adjustments.
- Consider setting up a dedicated network share on the host Mac if needed within Proxmox'es Linux hosts and ensure proper permissions are set so you can access necessary workflow files from your containerized environment remotely when using Parallels Vision, which supports macOS file sharing with appropriate settings enabled in its configuration.
- As an alternative approach to avoid syncing configurations between machines altogether—it would be wise to store all persistent data like slicer configurations or any other relevant workflow files on a shared storage solution accessible by your containers within Proxmox VMs, ensuring they remain localized and prevent synchronization issues inherent when using traditional remote desktop setups.
- If you are working collaboratively with others in different locations who need access to the same 3D models or slicer configurations—you may explore options for centralizing data storage within your Proxmox infrastructure, possibly leveraging cloud object stores that can be integrated as shared persistent repositories accessible by all machines involved.

Keep in mind this suggestion is tailored towards Mac users given Parallels Desktop Vision's compatibility and seamless macOS support but does not exclude the consideration of a Linux or Windows-based host for Proxmox, especially when VMware guests are used with additional configuration to achieve similar workflow persistence without syncing across machines. Remember that licensing costs may vary based on usage frequency, so it's always good practice to consider free alternatives like LXC/Docker if your budget is a concern and performance requirements for 3D modeling tasks can be met by other solutions compatible with Linux-based Proxmox hosts (while being aware of the limitations regarding GUI support in Docker on MacOS).
