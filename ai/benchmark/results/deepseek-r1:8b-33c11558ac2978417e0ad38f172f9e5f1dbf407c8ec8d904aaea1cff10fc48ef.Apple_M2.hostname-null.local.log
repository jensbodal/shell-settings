Okay, so I need to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to run on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations. The user prefers macOS but is open to Linux or Windows if necessary. Their main goal is to centralize the workflow locally so they don't have to sync configurations between machines.

First, I should understand what containerized environments are. Containers are lightweight virtualization technologies that allow you to package up an application and its dependencies together. They can be deployed on any platform that supports containers, which Proxmox does through LXC or Docker.

The key here is "persistent workflows." That means the user needs to have their configurations, settings, and data preserved across sessions. So whatever solution they choose must support persistence.

They mentioned 3D printing slicer configuration, so I should consider applications like Cura, Slic3r, or similar tools. These are typically used for generating G-code from 3D models.

Proxmox is a Linux-based virtualization platform, so the environment will run on Linux unless there's a need to run macOS or Windows in a container. The user prefers macOS but is okay with others if needed.

So, possible options include:

1. **macOS in Proxmox**: Running macOS as a container within Proxmox. There are some challenges here because macOS is not officially supported by Proxmox, and the process of setting it up might be complex or have limitations.

2. **Linux Container (LXC) or Docker on Proxmox**: Using containers directly on Proxmox, which supports LXC natively. This is easier since Proxmox is built on Linux and can handle containerization through tools like Docker or LXC.

3. **Windows in a Container**: While less common, some users might prefer certain Windows applications that aren't available on macOS or Linux.

The user wants to avoid syncing configurations across machines by centralizing the workflow locally. That suggests they need a single source of truth where all their settings and data live, so when they access it from any machine, everything is up-to-date.

I should look into solutions that support persistent storage within containers, such as using volumes or bind mounts to attach directories on the host system to the container's filesystem. This way, changes made inside the container are reflected outside of it, maintaining persistence.

Additionally, security and resource management could be considerations. Since they're managing a slicer configuration, which might involve sensitive data or large files (like 3D models), ensuring that the environment is secure and doesn't consume too many resources is important.

Looking at specific solutions:

- **Docker with persistent volumes**: Proxmox supports Docker, so this could be a straightforward approach. Each container can have a volume that persists on the host.
  
- **LXC templates**: Proxmox allows creating LXC templates which can be cloned and managed. These can include necessary software pre-installed.
  
- **Third-party tools like V2D (Virtualization to Docker)**: There are tools that allow converting virtual machines into containers, which could help in maintaining persistence.

For macOS in a container, Proxmox might not support it natively, but with tools like Mac OS X Server or using third-party solutions like Boot Camp in a container (though unlikely), it's more complex.

Comparing the options:

- **Docker on Proxmox**: Easiest setup. Persistent volumes can be easily managed, and many applications have Docker images available, including 3D printers slicers.
  
- **LXC Templates**: Could provide a lightweight solution with persistent data. However, it might require more manual configuration compared to Docker.

- **macOS**: More challenging but could offer better compatibility for certain applications. It's important to check if the slicer software has macOS support and whether Proxmox can handle macOS containers effectively.

- **Windows Containers**: Might be less preferable unless the user specifically needs Windows-based applications, which seems unlikely given the preference for macOS.

Considering all this, Docker on Proxmox seems like a solid choice. It's widely supported, easy to set up, and persistent volumes make configuration management straightforward. For macOS, while not natively supported, there might be community solutions or workaround methods that could work, though they might be less reliable.

Another consideration is performance. Containers are lightweight, so even with persistence, the overhead should be manageable on Proxmox. However, if the user is running this as a production environment for 3D printing, it's important to ensure that the host system has sufficient resources allocated to the container.

Lastly, documentation and community support will play a role in ease of use. Docker has extensive documentation and a large community, which can be helpful if there are any issues.

The optimal solution for setting up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox to manage persistent 3D printing slicer configurations is as follows:

**1. Use Docker on Proxmox:**
   - **Setup**: Install Docker on your Proxmox host using the official Docker installation guide for Linux.
   
**2. Persistent Volumes:**
   - Configure Docker to use persistent volumes by mapping specific directories on the host system to the container's filesystem. This ensures that data and configurations are preserved across container restarts or res Starts.

**3. Application Management:**
   - Install the required 3D printing slicer applications (e.g., Cura, Slic3r) using Docker images available from repositories like Docker Hub.
   - Create a comprehensive Dockerfile to set up a custom environment with all necessary dependencies and configurations, ensuring consistency across different instances.

**4. Security and Resource Management:**
   - Use resource limits within Docker to manage CPU and memory usage.
   - Implement strong authentication and encryption for secure access to the containerized environment.

**5. Access and Management:**
   - Utilize tools like `docker exec` or `docker compose` to access and manage containers from the command line, allowing for easy management of multiple instances.

By selecting Docker on Proxmox, you achieve a robust, persistent, and secure environment tailored for managing 3D printing workflows effectively.
