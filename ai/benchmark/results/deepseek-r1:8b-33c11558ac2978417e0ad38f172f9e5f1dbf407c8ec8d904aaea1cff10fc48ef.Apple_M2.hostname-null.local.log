Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to use with Proxmox for managing persistent workflows, specifically things like 3D printing slicer configurations. Hmm, the user prefers macOS but is open to Linux or Windows if needed. The main goal is to centralize the workflow in a local remote desktop without syncing configs between machines.

First, I need to understand what exactly they're looking for. They want something containerized, so that means using containers like Docker. Proxmox is a virtualization platform, so maybe they'll use it to run VMs or containers on their hardware.

The key here is persistence. The user wants configurations saved centrally so they don't have to sync between machines. So whatever solution they choose should store settings and data in a central location, probably within the container or VM itself. That way, when they access the remote desktop from another machine, everything is already there without needing to transfer files.

They mentioned 3D printing slicer configuration. I'm assuming that's something like Cura, Printrun, or similar software. These tools likely require specific settings and projects that need to be accessed consistently across different devices.

Now, thinking about the operating systems: macOS preference but Linux or Windows acceptable. If they can use a container that runs on any of these, that would be ideal. Maybe using a cross-platform solution within a container.

I remember that Proxmox has support for Docker and can run containers in their environment. So perhaps using a remote desktop setup with a container that's persistent. I've heard of Remote Desktop Services (RDS) being used on Linux, but it's more commonly associated with Windows environments. But maybe there are RDS-like solutions available for Linux.

Also, considering that Proxmox might allow them to run multiple containers or VMs, each handling different remote desktop instances with their own configurations.

I think using a container-based approach with persistent storage could work well here. For example, if they use something like V2D (Virtualization to Docker) to create persistent containers on Proxmox. That way, when the container restarts, all configurations are retained without needing external storage.

Another thought is about centralized management. Maybe using a solution that allows multiple instances of the 3D slicer to access a shared configuration directory within the Proxmox environment. This would eliminate the need for syncing across machines because everything is stored centrally on the Proxmox host.

I should also consider whether the slicer software needs graphical processing, especially if it's something like Cura which might be more resource-heavy. So the container or VM needs to have sufficient graphics drivers and resources allocated in Proxmox.

Maybe looking into specific solutions that provide persistent remote desktop environments in containers. I've heard of projects like Dooomsday or perhaps using X2Go with Docker, but I'm not sure if they fit here.

Wait, X2Go is a remote desktop solution that can run Linux applications on macOS and Windows clients. Maybe integrating it within a container could allow for persistent sessions. But I need to check if that's feasible with Proxmox.

Alternatively, using something like NoMachine or TigerVNC within a container. These are lightweight remote desktop solutions that might work well in a containerized environment. Plus, they can be configured to use persistent storage so settings and data aren't lost when the container restarts.

I'm also thinking about how to handle user authentication and permissions. The configurations need to be secure but easily accessible by authorized users without involving external syncing services.

Putting it all together, perhaps the best approach is to run a container with a remote desktop solution that uses persistent volumes for storage. This way, when you access the remote desktop from any device, the configurations are already there. Since Proxmox supports Docker and can manage containers with persistent storage, this seems feasible.

So, step by step: Install Proxmox, set up a container using Docker, install the remote desktop software (like TigerVNC), configure it to use persistent volumes for user settings, applications, and data. Then, each time the user connects via their preferred device (macOS, Linux, Windows), they get access to the same centralized configuration without needing to sync.

I think this makes sense. The key is ensuring that the container or VM has enough resources allocated in Proxmox and that the remote desktop software supports persistent storage within the container.

To achieve a centralized, persistent remote desktop environment for managing 3D printing slicer configurations on Proxmox, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Proxmox**: Install Proxmox Virtualization on your hardware to manage containers or virtual machines.

2. **Create a Container with Persistent Storage**:
   - Use Docker within Proxmox to create a container that will host the remote desktop environment.
   - Configure the container with persistent volumes for user data, application configurations, and settings.

3. **Install Remote Desktop Software**:
   - Install TigerVNC or NoMachine within the container. These are lightweight solutions suitable for running Linux applications from macOS, Linux, or Windows clients.

4. **Configure Persistent Storage**:
   - Ensure that the remote desktop software uses persistent volumes to store user-specific settings and data.
   - This avoids data loss on container restarts by mounting directories as read-only or writable within the container's filesystem.

5. **Access from Preferred Devices**:
   - Connect to the remote desktop session via macOS, Linux, or Windows clients.
   - The centralized configurations are already present in the container, eliminating the need for syncing across machines.

6. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Allocate sufficient CPU, memory, and graphics resources in Proxmox to ensure smooth operation of the 3D printing slicer software, especially if it's resource-intensive.

7. **User Authentication and Security**:
   - Configure authentication methods securely within Proxmox to manage access to the centralized configurations.
   - Ensure permissions are set appropriately for authorized users without exposing sensitive data externally.

By following these steps, you create a robust, centralized remote desktop environment that persists configurations across devices, meeting your needs for efficient 3D printing workflows.
