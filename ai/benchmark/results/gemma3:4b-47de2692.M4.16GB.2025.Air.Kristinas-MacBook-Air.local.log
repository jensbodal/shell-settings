⠙ ⠙ Okay, this is a fantastic use case for containerized remote desktop environments! Centralizing workflows like 3D printing configurations dramatically reduces headaches. Let's break down the best options for Proxmox, considering your requirements (macOS preference, persistent workflows, avoiding syncing).

Here's a ranking of the top contenders, with detailed explanations to help you choose:

**1. Xrdp + Docker Desktop (macOS or Windows)**

* **Why it's Excellent:** This is arguably the *best* option, especially if you prioritize macOS. It's highly configurable, relatively easy to set up, and offers a robust, familiar desktop experience.
* **How it Works:**
    * **Xrdp:** A free and open-source implementation of Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). It allows you to connect to the container as if it were a standard Windows desktop.
    * **Docker Desktop:**  You run a Docker container with Windows (if you want a more Windows-like environment) or macOS (with some adjustments) inside. This provides a consistent environment and simplifies updates.
* **Pros:**
    * **macOS Native Experience:** Running macOS inside a container is the most seamless experience if that's your preferred workflow.
    * **Familiarity:**  Users will be immediately comfortable with a standard Windows or macOS desktop.
    * **Robust RDP:**  RDP is a mature and well-supported protocol for remote desktop access.
    * **Proxmox Integration:** Excellent integration with Proxmox – you can easily manage the container as a Proxmox virtual machine.
    * **Configuration Persistence:**  Changes made within the container *persist* – no need to manually sync.
* **Cons:**
    * **Resource Intensive:** Running a full desktop OS (even in a container) consumes more resources than lighter options.
    * **Windows Licensing:**  If using Windows inside the container, you'll need to address Windows licensing costs.
* **Estimated Setup Time:** Moderate (1-3 hours)
* **Cost:** Free (Open Source)

**2. VNC + Docker Desktop (macOS or Windows)**

* **Why it's Good:** VNC is a very popular and mature remote access protocol.  Similar to RDP, it provides a remote desktop experience.
* **How it Works:**  Similar to RDP, but using the VNC protocol.
* **Pros:**
    * **Mature Protocol:** VNC is a battle-tested protocol with wide compatibility.
    * **Cross-Platform:** Works well across macOS, Windows, and Linux clients.
    * **Lightweight:** Generally less resource-intensive than RDP.
* **Cons:**
    * **Security:** Traditionally, VNC had security vulnerabilities. Modern VNC implementations (TightVNC, UltraVNC) have improved security significantly, but RDP is often considered more secure.
    * **Performance:** Can be less responsive than RDP, especially over higher-latency connections.
* **Estimated Setup Time:** Moderate (1-2 hours)
* **Cost:** Free (Open Source)

**3.  Remmina + Docker (Linux)**

* **Why it's Good:** If you're comfortable primarily using Linux and want a lightweight option, Remmina is an excellent choice.
* **How it Works:** Remmina is a versatile remote desktop client that supports multiple protocols (RDP, VNC, SSH). You'd run a Docker container with a Linux desktop environment (e.g., Ubuntu).
* **Pros:**
    * **Lightweight:** Very efficient, uses fewer resources.
    * **Multiple Protocol Support:** Flexible for different remote desktop scenarios.
    * **Proxmox Integration:** Seamless integration.
* **Cons:**
    * **Linux-Centric:** Not ideal if you absolutely need macOS.
    * **Requires Linux Proficiency:**  You'll need to be comfortable with Linux command-line operations.
* **Estimated Setup Time:** Moderate (1-2 hours)
* **Cost:** Free (Open Source)


**4.  TightVNC + Docker (macOS or Windows)**

* **Why it's Good:** TightVNC is a popular, actively maintained VNC server.
* **How it Works:** Runs a VNC server within the Docker container.
* **Pros:**  Good performance, actively maintained.
* **Cons:**  Similar to VNC - security concerns if not configured correctly.

**Key Considerations & Recommendations for your 3D Printing Workflow**

* **Resource Allocation:**  For 3D printing, you'll want a decent amount of RAM (at least 4GB, ideally 8GB or more) and CPU power within the container.
* **Network:**  A stable, low-latency network connection is *critical* for a responsive remote desktop experience, especially when interacting with a 3D printer.
* **Security:** *Always* use strong passwords and consider enabling two-factor authentication for your Proxmox host.  Configure firewalls appropriately.

**Here's my recommendation based on your priorities:**

* **Best Overall:** **Xrdp + Docker Desktop (macOS)** -  The most seamless and familiar experience, excellent for a 3D printing workflow if macOS is your preference.
* **Best Value:** **Xrdp + Docker Desktop (Windows)** - if Windows licensing is available, this provides a good balance of performance, ease of use, and cost.

To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me:

*   **Which OS do you *prefer* to use?** (macOS, Windows, Linux?)
*   **What specific 3D printing software are you using?** (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer, Simplify3D) – this helps in determining the resources required.
*   **What's your network setup like?** (e.g., home internet, managed network)
