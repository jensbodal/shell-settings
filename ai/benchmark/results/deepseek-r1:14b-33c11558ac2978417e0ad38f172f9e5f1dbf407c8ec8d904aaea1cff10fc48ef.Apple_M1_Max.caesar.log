Okay, so I need to set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox. The main goal is to manage persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, and ideally, I want it to run on macOS, but Linux or Windows are also acceptable. I'm trying to avoid having to sync configurations between different machines by centralizing everything in this remote desktop.

First, I should figure out what containerization tools are available for Proxmox. Since Proxmox is based on Debian, I know that Docker is a solid choice because it's widely supported and integrates well with Linux systems. So, Docker seems like the way to go for containers.

Next, I need a remote desktop solution inside these containers. I remember there are a few options: VNC-based solutions like TightVNC or SPICE-based ones like Virt-manager. Since performance is important, especially for 3D slicing which can be resource-intensive, I should consider which one offers better graphics handling.

If I go with Docker, I might look into using something like Xfce or another lightweight desktop environment inside the container. But wait, macOS isn't natively supported by Docker containers, right? So if I really want a macOS feel, maybe I need to look into alternatives like VMs instead of containers because Docker doesn't support macOS guest OS.

Wait, but the user said macOS is preferred but Linux or Windows are acceptable. Maybe using a Linux container with a desktop environment would be better since it's more straightforward with Docker. Alternatively, if I wanted to use macOS, perhaps a VM would be necessary, which Proxmox can handle as it supports full virtualization with KVM.

So, considering that, maybe running a Linux container with a remote desktop makes sense. But how do I set up the containers and integrate them into Proxmox? Proxmox has its own container system (LXC) but Docker is also supported via a module. So perhaps using LXC for the base OS and then running Docker containers on top of that.

Wait, no, in Proxmox, each container is an LXC or VM, so maybe I should create a container (as an LXC) with Docker installed, and then run my remote desktop as a Docker service inside it. That way, the Proxmox host manages the container, which hosts Docker containers for specific applications.

Alternatively, maybe I can directly use Docker on the host node in Proxmox. But usually, Docker is managed within each container or via the host OS. Since the user wants persistence for workflows, maybe using a volume in Docker to map to a directory on the host machine would help keep configurations and data consistent across restarts.

So here's an outline:

1. Set up a Proxmox host.
2. Create a Linux container (LXC) as a VM or container instance.
3. Install Docker inside that LXC container.
4. Run a remote desktop environment in Docker, such as Xfce with VNC server.
5. Expose the VNC port to access it remotely.
6. Mount a directory from the host machine into the Docker container to keep configurations persistent.

Wait, but how does the remote desktop work? If I'm using VNC, I can connect to the container's IP and port. But for local management, maybe using Proxmox's web interface or another method?

Also, considering performance: 3D printing slicer software might require more resources, so the container needs enough CPU and RAM allocation. Maybe allocating a significant portion of resources to the container hosting the remote desktop.

Alternatively, if I use Virt-manager with SPICE, it might offer better performance for graphical applications. But in that case, maybe using a KVM VM instead of an LXC container because SPICE is more commonly associated with full virtualization.

So perhaps creating a KVM VM on Proxmox, installing Linux or Windows there, setting up a remote desktop with the necessary tools, and then using Docker inside that VM for specific applications. That way, I can have a persistent environment without worrying about syncing configurations across machines.

Wait, but the original question was about containerized remote desktops. So maybe mixing containers within a VM might complicate things. Alternatively, use a single container with a remote desktop environment that's set up to handle the necessary applications and file storage.

Another consideration: if I'm using macOS as preferred, maybe booting a Mac via KVM isn't straightforward because macOS requires special hardware for virtualization. So perhaps using Windows or Linux is more feasible in Proxmox VMs.

In summary, my steps might be:

- Use Proxmox to create a Debian-based LXC container with Docker installed.
- Inside that container, run a Docker image with a lightweight desktop environment (like Xfce) and configure remote access via VNC.
- Mount a directory from the host machine into the Docker container to store configurations and data persistently.
- Access this remote desktop either through Proxmox's web interface or directly via VNC client.

Alternatively, if I prefer macOS but can't due to hardware constraints, go with a Linux VM with similar setup.

I think I'm getting somewhere. Now, let me outline the steps in a more structured way.

To set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, follow these organized steps:

### Steps to Set Up Containerized Remote Desktop Environment on Proxmox

1. **Proxmox Host Setup**:
   - Ensure your Proxmox host is installed and configured with sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, storage) for the tasks.

2. **Create an LXC Container**:
   - In Proxmox, create a new Linux container (LXC) based on Debian or Ubuntu.
   - Allocate adequate resources to this container to handle graphical applications.

3. **Install Docker in the LXC Container**:
   - Once the container is running, install Docker by following standard installation procedures for your chosen OS.
   - Verify Docker installation by running a test command (e.g., `docker run hello-world`).

4. **Set Up Remote Desktop Environment with Docker**:
   - Pull a lightweight Linux desktop environment Docker image (e.g., `debian:xfce`, `ubuntu:xserver-nogtk`).
   - Run the Docker image, exposing necessary ports for remote access (e.g., VNC port 5900).

5. **Configure Remote Desktop Access**:
   - Install a VNC server (e.g., TigerVNC) inside the Docker container.
   - Configure it to listen on port 5900 and allow remote connections.

6. **Mount Persistent Storage**:
   - Map a directory from your Proxmox host into the Docker container using the `-v` flag in the `docker run` command.
   - This ensures that configurations and data persist even after container restarts.

7. **Access the Remote Desktop**:
   - Use a VNC client (e.g., Remmina, TightVNC) to connect to the Proxmox host's IP on port 5900.
   - Alternatively, access it via the Proxmox web interface if configured for remote desktop services.

8. **Optimize Performance and Resources**:
   - Adjust resource allocation in Proxmox (CPU, RAM, GPU if needed) for optimal performance of the remote desktop applications.
   - Consider using a faster network interface for smoother remote sessions.

9. **Optional: Alternative Setup with KVM VM**:
   - If preferring macOS or needing better graphics support, create a KVM VM in Proxmox.
   - Install Linux or Windows within this VM and set up a remote desktop environment.
   - Use Docker inside the VM to host specific applications as needed.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can create a centralized, containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox. This setup allows for persistent workflows, avoiding configuration synchronization across devices. The choice between LXC containers with Docker or KVM VMs depends on your OS preference and performance needs.
