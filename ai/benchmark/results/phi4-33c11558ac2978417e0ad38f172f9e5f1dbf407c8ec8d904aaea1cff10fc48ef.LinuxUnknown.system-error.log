⠙ ⠙ ⠸ To achieve a centralized and containerized remote desktop environment for managing persistent workflows such as 3D printer slicer configuration using Proxmox, you have several options depending on your preferred operating system. Here are some suggestions:

### Linux-Based Solutions

1. **X2Go:**
   - **Description:** X2Go is an open-source remote desktop solution that supports session persistence and works well with containerized environments.
   - **Setup:** You can run a lightweight Linux distribution like Ubuntu or Debian in a Proxmox LXC container, then install X2Go server components. Use the X2Go client on your local machine to connect.
   - **Advantages:** It offers good performance over various network conditions and supports session persistence.

2. **NoMachine:**
   - **Description:** NoMachine provides high-performance remote desktop capabilities with support for Linux, Windows, and macOS clients.
   - **Setup:** Install NoMachine on a containerized Ubuntu or Debian system running in Proxmox. Configure the server side inside the container and use the client software to connect.
   - **Advantages:** Known for its speed and low latency, it also supports session persistence.

3. **TigerVNC with web-based management:**
   - **Description:** TigerVNC is a robust VNC implementation that can be used in containerized environments.
   - **Setup:** Set up a Proxmox LXC container with your preferred Linux distribution and install TigerVNC server. Use a browser-based interface like Guacamole to access the remote desktop from any device.
   - **Advantages:** Lightweight and flexible, it allows easy integration into web services for remote management.

### macOS Preference

If you prefer a macOS environment:

1. **Parallels Remote Application Server (RAS):**
   - **Description:** Parallels RAS is designed to provide Mac users with a seamless way to access virtual machines remotely.
   - **Setup:** While not directly containerized, you can use Proxmox to manage VMs that run macOS and then deploy Parallels RAS for remote desktop capabilities. This requires a macOS VM setup on Proxmox.
   - **Advantages:** Native support for macOS applications and seamless integration with Mac clients.

### Windows-Based Solutions

If you are open to using Windows:

1. **Windows Server Remote Desktop Services (RDS):**
   - **Description:** RDS allows you to host multiple remote desktop sessions on a single server, which can be containerized in Proxmox.
   - **Setup:** Create a Windows Server VM or container in Proxmox and configure it with RDS.
   - **Advantages:** Provides robust support for session persistence and is well-suited for managing complex workflows.

2. **Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Solutions:**
   - **Description:** Use VDI solutions like Citrix Virtual Apps & Desktops or Microsoft Remote Desktop Services to manage persistent sessions.
   - **Setup:** Deploy these on a Windows Server running in Proxmox and connect using compatible clients.
   - **Advantages:** Offers advanced features for managing multiple user sessions and workflows.

### General Considerations

- **Performance:** Ensure your Proxmox host has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to handle the demands of a remote desktop environment.
- **Network Configuration:** Optimize network settings for low latency and high throughput, especially if accessing over WAN connections.
- **Security:** Implement strong authentication and encryption methods to secure your remote sessions.

By selecting one of these solutions based on your operating system preference and specific requirements, you can effectively centralize and manage your 3D printing workflows with persistent configurations.
