⠙ ⠹ ⠸ For setting up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmux that can handle persistent workflows such as 3D printer slicing configurations, there are several options you can consider. Here’s a breakdown of potential solutions for macOS, Linux, and Windows environments:

### Linux-Based Solutions

1. **X2Go with Docker:**
   - **Setup**: Use Docker to create an X11 server container paired with X2Go as the desktop environment.
   - **Advantages**: Lightweight, supports various desktops (XFCE, LXDE), and integrates well with Linux systems.
   - **Persistence**: Store configuration files within a persistent volume in your Proxmox setup.

2. **VNC Server with Docker:**
   - **Setup**: Deploy a VNC server inside a container. You can use lightweight desktop environments like XFCE or Lubuntu.
   - **Advantages**: Easy to set up and configure, suitable for basic remote access needs.
   - **Persistence**: Again, utilize persistent volumes to maintain configurations.

3. **Tigervnc with Proxmox VE Template:**
   - **Setup**: Use the built-in capabilities of Proxmox VE by deploying a VM from an existing template that includes TigerVNC.
   - **Advantages**: Seamless integration within Proxmox; reliable performance for desktop applications.
   - **Persistence**: Configuration files can be stored on shared storage accessible by your containerized environment.

### Windows-Based Solutions

1. **Windows Desktop with VNC:**
   - **Setup**: Use a Docker container running an older version of Windows (as official support for Windows containers is limited to Nano, Server Core) or set up a full VM.
   - **Advantages**: Native experience with all required applications like 3D Slicer available on Windows.
   - **Persistence**: Use network-shared storage solutions for configuration files.

### macOS-Based Solutions

macOS-specific options are more challenging due to licensing and the absence of official containerization support for desktop OS environments. However, you can simulate a similar experience using:

1. **Parallels or VMware Fusion with VNC Access:**
   - **Setup**: Run macOS in a virtual machine via Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion on a host system that supports these solutions.
   - **Advantages**: Full macOS environment access with all applications and configurations intact.
   - **Persistence**: Use shared folders for configuration files.

2. **Remote Desktop Tools (e.g., Screen Sharing):**
   - **Setup**: Access macOS remotely through native remote desktop features available in macOS, like Apple Remote Desktop or VNC Server.
   - **Advantages**: No need for containerization; straightforward setup if you have direct access to the machine.
   - **Persistence**: Store configurations on network-attached storage.

### Considerations:

- **Security**: Ensure secure access by using strong passwords and possibly implementing SSH tunneling for encrypted connections.
- **Performance**: The choice of desktop environment can significantly affect performance. Lightweight environments like XFCE or LXDE are recommended if you're resource-constrained.
- **Storage Solutions**: Utilize Proxmox's shared storage capabilities to ensure your configuration files remain persistent across sessions.

By carefully selecting the right setup based on these options, you can create a robust and efficient remote desktop environment that suits your workflow needs.
