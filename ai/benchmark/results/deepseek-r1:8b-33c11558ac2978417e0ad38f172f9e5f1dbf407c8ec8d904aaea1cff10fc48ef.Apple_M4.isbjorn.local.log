Okay, so I need to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to run on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. The user prefers macOS but is open to Linux or Windows if necessary. Their main goal is to avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing the workflow locally in a remote desktop.

First, I should understand what containerized environments are and how they can be used here. Containers are isolated environments that package up everything needed for an application to run, including dependencies. This could be useful because it allows the remote desktop to have all necessary tools without worrying about version conflicts or missing software across different machines.

Proxmox is a Linux-based open-source virtualization platform, so running containers on it should be straightforward since Docker and container runtimes are widely supported in Linux. That makes sense because Proxmox is already a solid choice for container orchestration.

Now, the user wants to manage persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations. This means they need a setup where their settings, custom profiles, and projects are saved and accessible across sessions without having to reconfigure each time they switch machines or restart services. So, the solution should provide persistence across reboots or service restarts.

The user prefers macOS but is okay with Linux or Windows if necessary. That probably means I should look for cross-platform solutions that can run on all three operating systems within containers. Alternatively, if a native macOS container isn't feasible, maybe a way to run macOS in a container on Proxmox would work, but that's complicated because macOS is proprietary and not open-source.

Wait, running macOS as a container on Proxmox might not be straightforward since macOS only runs on Apple hardware with specific drivers. So maybe a virtual machine approach is needed instead of containers for macOS? That could complicate things because Proxmox is more geared towards containerization than full virtual machines, but it can support KVM-based VMs as well.

Alternatively, perhaps using a cross-platform solution within containers would be better. But what cross-platform remote desktop solutions are there that can run in containers?

I recall that NoMachine and VirtualBox both offer remote desktop capabilities. NoMachine has a server-client model where the server runs on Proxmox, and clients connect via a web interface. It also supports persistent sessions and can handle 3D applications decently.

VirtualBox is another option, but it's more of a traditional hypervisor. However, it might not be as container-friendly. Also, VirtualBox has a remote desktop extension that allows connecting to VMs over a browser.

Another option is Remote Desktop Services (RDS) from Microsoft, which can run on Linux using containers. RDS allows publishing applications and desktops, and with the right setup, configurations can be persistent across sessions. Since Proxmox supports containerized environments, RDS might fit well here.

I also remember that there's a way to use Docker and containerd as an alternative to traditional hypervisors for running VMs. Container containers (ccontainers) allow running VMs in a container, which could provide the isolation needed without relying on full hypervisors.

So, putting this together, perhaps using Proxmox with containerized RDS or NoMachine could be the way to go. Both support persistence and can handle 3D applications if configured properly. Since RDS is more of a Microsoft product, it might not integrate as seamlessly with Proxmox's container orchestration, but it's definitely possible.

Wait, but if the user prefers macOS, using RDS or NoMachine in containers on Proxmox would require either running macOS in a VM (which isn't straightforward) or having a cross-platform solution within containers. Alternatively, perhaps using a Linux-based remote desktop that can also run macOS applications via compatibility layers or emulators.

Another angle: maybe the user doesn't need to have the entire OS in a container but just the application and settings. So, a containerized approach where the 3D slicer runs in a container with persistent storage could work. That way, the application is contained, and configuration files are stored in a persistent volume.

But then I'm thinking about how Proxmox handles container storage. Persistent volumes can be attached as containers run, allowing data to persist even after container restarts. So, if the slicer runs in a container with its settings saved to a persistent volume, that could solve the synchronization issue.

In terms of remote desktop environments within containers, I think Remote Desktop Services (RDS) is a good fit because it's designed for application delivery and can be integrated into containerized environments. Microsoft has been pushing RDS in Azure but also supports self-hosted setups where you run an RDS server on your own infrastructure.

So the plan would be:

1. Install Proxmox on the Linux host.
2. Use Docker or containerd to pull an RDS image and configure it as a remote desktop server within a container.
3. Attach persistent volumes for user profiles, configurations, etc., so they persist across sessions.
4. Access the RDS via a web interface from any machine (preferably using macOS if possible).

Alternatively, NoMachine's Server might be better suited since it's designed for user experience and offers more native remote desktop features.

Wait, but can NoMachine run in a container? I'm not sure. Maybe as a VM instead. Alternatively, their client software could connect to a Proxmox host running NoMachine as a service or application.

Another thought: if the user wants macOS, perhaps using a MacStadium or similar hardware, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, considering that Proxmox can support both containers and virtual machines, maybe running macOS in a VM and then connecting to it via remote desktop tools like NoMachine or VirtualBox Extension Pack. But as I said earlier, getting macOS into Proxmox would require KVM support with specific drivers which might not be straightforward.

So perhaps the best approach is to use a cross-platform container solution that can run on Proxmox, allowing for macOS-like experiences within containers. Or, using RDS with a persistent setup where configurations are stored in a central location accessible by all containers.

I'm also thinking about how to manage user sessions and ensure that each user's configuration is isolated but persistent across different instances of the remote desktop. That suggests that user profiles should be stored in persistent storage, which can be handled via volumes attached to Proxmox containers.

So, putting it all together:

- Use containerized RDS on Proxmox.
- Attach persistent volumes for user data and configurations.
- Access the RDS from any client (preferably macOS) without syncing settings.
- Ensure that all application configurations are stored centrally so they're available wherever the RDS is accessed.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer would likely recommend using containerized RDS with Proxmox, attach persistent volumes for user profiles and configurations, and access it via a preferred client like macOS or other platforms.

I think that's the way to go. Now I need to structure this into a clear step-by-step explanation.

To achieve the desired remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing 3D printing slicer configurations with persistence across sessions, follow these steps:

### Solution Overview:
- **Containerized Remote Desktop Service (RDS)**: Utilize Microsoft's RDS in a containerized setup within Proxmox to provide a cross-platform remote desktop solution.
- **Persistent Volumes**: Attach persistent storage volumes to ensure user profiles, configurations, and settings remain accessible across sessions and reboots.
- **Access from Preferred Clients**: Access the RDS via macOS if possible or alternative platforms as needed.

### Step-by-Step Implementation:

1. **Install Proxmox**:
   - Install Proxmox on your Linux-based host system to leverage its container orchestration capabilities.

2. **Set Up Docker/Containerd**:
   - Ensure Docker or containerd is installed and running on the Proxmox host, as it will be used to pull and run RDS images.

3. **Pull Microsoft Remote Desktop Server (RDS) Image**:
   - Use Docker to fetch an RDS image suitable for your environment. For example:
     ```bash
     docker pull microsoft/rdsimages:next-gen
     ```
   - This image will be used to create a container acting as the RDS server.

4. **Create Persistent Volumes**:
   - Create persistent volumes in Proxmox that will store user profiles and configurations. These can be mounted within the container.
   - Example command (replace with your volume name):
     ```bash
     lvcreate -n rds-persist -L 50G /dev/sda2
     ```
   - Mount these volumes during container startup to ensure data persistence.

5. **Run RDS as a Container**:
   - Use Docker to start the RDS server within a container, attaching the persistent volume.
     ```bash
     docker run --name rds-server \
       -e RDS_ROLE=RemoteDesktopServer \
       -v /path/to/persistent/volumes:/rds/persist \
       microsoft/rdsimages:next-gen
     ```
   - Replace `/path/to/persistent/volumes` with your actual persistent volume path.

6. **Access the Remote Desktop**:
   - Use a client (preferably macOS or other platforms) to connect to the RDS via the server's hostname or IP.
     - The connection can be made using a web interface or native RDS clients if installed on the client machine.

7. **Configure and Manage Applications**:
   - Install necessary applications like 3D slicers within the container, ensuring they run as services for persistence.
   - Store all application settings, custom profiles, and configurations in the persistent volume to maintain consistency across sessions.

8. **Verify Persistence**:
   - Reboot the Proxmox host and ensure that remote desktop sessions are preserved with user data intact due to the attached persistent volumes.

### Notes:
- **Cross-Platform Support**: RDS supports multiple platforms, so macOS clients can connect seamlessly.
- **Performance Considerations**: Ensure your Proxmox host has sufficient resources for smooth 3D application performance.
- **Security**: Follow best practices for securing containerized environments and sensitive data stored in persistent volumes.

By following these steps, you'll have a centralized, persistent remote desktop environment that avoids configuration syncing across machines, ideal for managing workflows like 3D printing.
