Okay, so I need to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to run on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations. The user prefers macOS but is open to Linux or Windows if necessary. The main goal is to avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing everything in a local remote desktop.

First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They want a setup where all their important applications and configurations are stored locally on Proxmox, so they don't have to sync files across different machines. This means each container or VM would have its own persistent storage, keeping everything centralized.

Proxmox is a Proxmox Virtualization platform, which allows hosting virtual servers (VMs) and containers. So the solution needs to leverage Proxmox's capabilities for containerization and virtualization.

The user mentioned 3D printing slicer configuration, so they likely need access to software like Cura, Prusament, or similar tools. These might be available on all three platforms: macOS, Linux, and Windows. But since the preference is for macOS, I should see if there's a way to run those apps in a containerized environment on Proxmox.

Thinking about containerization, Docker is commonly used, but Proxmox also supports containers directly or through tools like lxd. However, I remember that Proxmox has its own container system called Proxmox Containers, which might be more integrated with the overall platform.

Persistent storage in containers can be handled using volumes. So each container would have a persistent volume where configurations are stored. This way, when the container restarts or is moved, the data remains accessible.

Since the user wants to avoid syncing between machines, having a central location where all configurations are stored within each container's volume makes sense. That way, each time they access the remote desktop, their applications have access to the same configuration files from the persistent volume.

For macOS, running native apps in containers might be tricky because macOS is not Linux-based. But there are tools like macvim or x11vnc which can allow Linux-based containers to display GUI applications. Alternatively, using Parallels or VirtualBox within a container might help run macOS containers, but that could complicate things.

Alternatively, if running macOS in Proxmox isn't feasible, maybe the user should consider a headless macOS instance within a container, accessed via VNC or something similar. But I'm not sure how well that would work with persistent storage.

Another approach is to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on macOS to run containers. This might allow using Docker and having persistent volumes attached directly to the WSL environment, which then can be accessed by the remote desktop. However, this adds another layer of complexity and may not be necessary if there's a better way.

For Linux containers, it's more straightforward because all the tools are native. So using Proxmox Containers with Docker installed would allow for easy setup. The user could create separate containers for each application, like Cura, and have their configuration files stored in persistent volumes attached to those containers.

If the user needs access from different machines but wants everything centralized, they can connect to the same container each time via a remote desktop session. Since Proxmox allows for VMs with shared storage, perhaps using VMs instead of containers might provide more stability and flexibility, especially if 3D printing slicers are resource-intensive.

Wait, but the user specifically mentioned containerized environments, so maybe sticking with containers is better unless it's not feasible. Also, considering that Proxmox supports both VMs and containers, combining them could be beneficial.

In terms of remote desktop access, tools like NoMachine or TigerVNC can provide remote sessions to either the container or VM. These tools support persistent desktop environments, which fits with the requirement of centralizing configurations.

Another point is backups and snapshots in Proxmox. The user might need to ensure that their containers and configurations are regularly backed up to avoid data loss. Proxmox allows for snapshots, so setting up automated backups could be part of the solution.

Putting this all together, the best approach seems to be using containerized environments on Proxmox with persistent volumes for each application, ensuring that configurations are stored locally within those containers. The user can then access these containers via a remote desktop session, whether through TigerVNC or NoMachine, and have their settings centralized without needing to sync between machines.

I should also consider whether the applications require specific dependencies or if there are any compatibility issues with Proxmox's container setup. Testing might be necessary, but assuming that Docker on Proxmox can handle the necessary software installations, this approach should work.

So, in summary, the steps would involve:

1. Installing Proxmox on their server.
2. Setting up persistent containers for each application (like Cura) using Docker within Proxmox Containers.
3. Configuring these containers with persistent volumes to store slicer configurations.
4. Accessing these containers via a remote desktop solution like TigerVNC or NoMachine, ensuring that the environment persists across sessions.

I think this should meet the user's requirements of centralizing configurations locally without syncing between machines and providing access to preferred or alternative platforms as needed.

To achieve a centralized and persistent containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing 3D printing slicer configurations, follow these steps:

### Solution Overview:
Utilize Proxmox's capabilities to run containers with persistent volumes, allowing your applications and configurations to remain centralized and accessible from any machine without syncing.

### Steps:

1. **Install Proxmox:**
   - Install the Proxmox Virtualization software on your server to leverage its container and VM management features.

2. **Set Up Persistent Containers:**
   - Use Proxmox Containers to create persistent containers for each application, such as Cura.
   - Each container will have a persistent volume where configurations are stored, ensuring they remain accessible even after container restarts or reboots.

3. **Configure Applications:**
   - Install necessary 3D printing applications (e.g., Cura) within the containers using Docker.
   - Ensure each application has access to its configuration files stored in the persistent volume.

4. **Remote Desktop Access:**
   - Use TigerVNC or NoMachine for remote desktop access to your containerized environments.
   - These tools support persistent sessions, allowing you to access the same environment across different machines without syncing configurations.

5. **Backup and Snapshots:**
   - Configure Proxmox to take regular snapshots of containers and VMs to safeguard against data loss.
   - Automate backups to ensure your slicer configurations are secure and always available.

6. **Access from Different Platforms:**
   - Access the containerized environment via a preferred platform (macOS, Linux, or Windows) using appropriate tools:
     - For macOS, consider headless solutions or Parallels within containers.
     - Use WSL on macOS for Docker access if necessary, though native Proxmox containers are recommended.

### Considerations:
- **Compatibility:** Ensure your 3D printing applications work well within containerized environments and have any required dependencies installed.
- **Performance:** Check resource requirements to ensure smooth operation, especially for resource-intensive tasks like slicing.

By following these steps, you can centralize your workflows, maintain persistence across sessions, and access your configurations from any machine without the need for syncing. This setup ensures efficient management and scalability of your remote desktop environment on Proxmox.
