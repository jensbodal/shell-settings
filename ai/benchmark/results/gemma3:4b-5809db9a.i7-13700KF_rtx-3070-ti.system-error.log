*   **MCP is an open protocol** designed to seamlessly connect LLM applications with external data sources and tools, providing a standardized way to share contextual information and expose capabilities.
*   **It utilizes JSON-RPC 2.0** for communication between Hosts (LLM applications), Clients (connectors), and Servers (services providing context and tools).
*   **Security and Trust are paramount**, requiring implementors to prioritize user consent, data privacy, and careful consideration of tool safety, alongside robust authorization flows and appropriate access controls.
