⠙ ⠙ Okay, let's break down the best containerized remote desktop environments for Proxmox, specifically geared toward managing persistent 3D printing workflows like slicer configurations. You're right to focus on containerization to avoid syncing across machines - that's a smart move for consistency.

Here's a breakdown of the top contenders, considering macOS, Linux, and Windows, along with their strengths and weaknesses for your use case:

**1. Remmina + Docker Container (Highly Recommended - Flexible & Mature)**

* **Why it's good:** This is arguably the *most* flexible and generally best solution. It leverages Remmina, a powerful open-source VNC client, combined with a Docker container for isolation and management.
* **How it works:**
    * **Docker Container:** You'd create a Docker image containing your preferred OS (macOS, Linux, or Windows).  This container would include:
        * Your slicer software (PrusaSlicer, Cura, etc.)
        * Any necessary drivers or utilities.
        * Your desired desktop environment (e.g., macOS Monterey, Ubuntu Desktop, Windows 11).
    * **Remmina:** Remmina connects to the Docker container via VNC.  You essentially have a virtualized environment running on Proxmox, accessible through Remmina.
* **Pros:**
    * **Highly Customizable:** You have complete control over the container image.
    * **Performance:** VNC over a Proxmox host is usually very good.
    * **Isolation:** Containerization protects your Proxmox host from potential issues within the remote desktop environment.
    * **Supports All OSes:** You can tailor the container to your specific operating system.
    * **Mature & Stable:**  Remmina is well-established and reliable.
* **Cons:**
    * **More Setup:** Requires more configuration than simpler options.
    * **VNC Learning Curve:**  You'll need to understand VNC concepts.

**2.  Xfce4/MATE Remote Desktop with Docker (Good for Linux Users)**

* **Why it’s good:** If you're primarily using Linux, this is a solid alternative.  It builds upon a lightweight desktop environment (Xfce or MATE) within a Docker container.
* **How it works:** Similar to the above, but the Docker container runs a pre-configured Linux desktop environment.
* **Pros:**
    * **Lightweight:** Xfce/MATE are resource-efficient.
    * **Good Performance:**  Generally fast on Proxmox.
    * **Containerized:** Isolation is a key benefit.
* **Cons:**
    * **Linux Focused:**  Not ideal if you *need* macOS functionality directly.
    * **Configuration Required:** Still requires Docker setup.


**3.  TightVNC + Docker (Simpler, but Less Robust)**

* **Why it's good:** TightVNC is a simpler VNC server compared to Remmina. If you want a quicker, less-featured setup, this can work.
* **How it works:** Docker container runs your desktop environment and your slicer.
* **Pros:**
    * **Easy Setup:**  Simpler to configure than Remmina.
    * **Lightweight:** Can be good for lower-powered Proxmox hosts.
* **Cons:**
    * **Limited Features:** TightVNC lacks the advanced features of Remmina (e.g., tabbed browsing, better control).
    * **Less Flexible:**  Less control over the remote desktop experience.



**4.  Microsoft Remote Desktop (Windows Only - Limited)**

* **Why it's good:** If you *absolutely* need Windows for your workflow and are already familiar with it, this can be a viable option.
* **How it works:** Create a Docker container with Windows 10/11. Connect using the Microsoft Remote Desktop client.
* **Pros:**
    * **Familiar Interface:** If you're used to Windows, it’s easy to use.
* **Cons:**
    * **Windows Only:** Obvious limitation.
    * **Resource Intensive:** Windows containers can be more demanding on Proxmox.
    * **Licensing:** You’ll need a valid Windows license.



**Here's a table summarizing the options:**

| Feature          | Remmina + Docker | Xfce4/MATE + Docker | TightVNC + Docker | Microsoft RDP + Docker |
|------------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **OS Support**    | All              | Linux (primarily)     | All              | Windows Only            |
| **Ease of Setup** | Moderate         | Moderate            | Easy             | Moderate               |
| **Performance**   | Excellent        | Good                | Good             | Good to Moderate       |
| **Flexibility**   | High             | Moderate            | Moderate         | Moderate               |
| **Isolation**     | Excellent        | Good                | Good             | Good                    |

**Recommendations for Your 3D Printing Workflow:**

* **Best Overall:** **Remmina + Docker** – This offers the best balance of flexibility, performance, and control, particularly if you want to use macOS.
* **Best for Linux Users:** **Xfce4/MATE + Docker** - Great if you're comfortable with Linux and want a lighter footprint.

**Proxmox Considerations:**

* **CPU & RAM:** Make sure your Proxmox host has enough resources to run the container.  A 4-8 core CPU and 8GB+ of RAM are recommended, especially if you're running multiple containers.
* **Storage:** Use an SSD for your Proxmox host to ensure fast container startup and performance.

To help me narrow down the best recommendation for *you*, could you tell me:

*   **What operating system do you prefer?** (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
*   **What is your level of technical comfort?** (Beginner, intermediate, advanced)
*   **What is your primary slicer software?** (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura)
