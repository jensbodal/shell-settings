⠙ ⠹ Okay, let's break down the best containerized remote desktop environments for your Proxmox setup, specifically geared towards persistent 3D printing workflow management. You've hit on a great strategy – centralizing everything within a container eliminates syncing headaches.

Here's a breakdown of the top contenders, considering your macOS preference, and focusing on features relevant to your needs:

**1. Remmina with Docker/Proxmox Integration – Top Recommendation**

* **Why it's great:** This is arguably the *best* balanced approach for your requirements.
    * **Flexibility:** Remmina is a powerful, free, and open-source VNC and RDP client.  You'll primarily use it to *connect* to the container running your desired OS.
    * **Containerization:**  You'll run your macOS, Linux, or Windows environment inside a Docker container. This provides isolation and easy rollback.
    * **Proxmox Integration:** Proxmox's built-in container management makes deploying and managing Docker containers extremely simple.
    * **Persistent Workflows:**  Since the container remains running, your 3D printing slicer configuration and other workflow tools stay consistent.
    * **Cost:** Free!
* **How it works:**
    * **Docker Image:**  You'll create a Dockerfile that sets up your chosen OS (macOS, Linux, or Windows) and installs your 3D printing software (PrusaSlicer, Cura, etc.).
    * **Remmina Connection:** On your Proxmox host (or another machine), you use Remmina to connect to the container’s IP address.  Remmina acts as the remote desktop client.
* **Pros:**
    * Free
    * Mature & Well-Supported
    * Very configurable Remmina
    * Excellent for both macOS and Linux
* **Cons:**
    * Requires a bit of Docker knowledge to set up the initial container.
    * Remmina is the client, so you need to install it on the connecting machine.



**2.  Xrdp with Docker – Good for Windows**

* **Why it's good:** If Windows is your primary choice, Xrdp is fantastic.
* **How it works:** Similar to Xrdp, it turns a Linux container into an RDP server.
* **Pros:**  Easy to set up RDP access to Windows containers. Excellent if you’re using Windows for your 3D printing software.
* **Cons:**  Not ideal for macOS directly (though possible with some configurations).

**3.  TightVNC with Docker – Simple & Lightweight**

* **Why it’s good:** TightVNC is a very lightweight VNC server that’s easy to get running quickly.
* **How it works:** You would install the TightVNC server inside the Docker container and connect to it using a VNC client.
* **Pros:** Extremely lightweight, fast, easy to configure for basic remote access.
* **Cons:** Less feature-rich than Remmina.  May not be as ideal for complex remote desktop workflows.



**4.  DeepVNC with Docker – Another VNC Option**

* Similar to TightVNC in terms of functionality.  Can be a viable alternative.


**Here's a Table Summarizing the Recommendations:**

| Feature          | Remmina + Docker | Xrdp + Docker | TightVNC + Docker |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **OS Support**    | macOS, Linux, Windows | Windows (best), Linux, macOS | macOS, Linux, Windows |
| **Ease of Setup** | Moderate         | Easy           | Easy              |
| **Feature Set**   | Excellent        | Good            | Basic             |
| **Performance**   | Very Good        | Good            | Good              |
| **Cost**          | Free             | Free            | Free              |



**Proxmox Specific Considerations:**

* **Storage:**  Choose an appropriate storage solution for your Docker containers – ideally an SSD for performance.
* **Networking:**  Ensure your Proxmox host has a static IP address or a reliable DHCP assignment to avoid connectivity issues.
* **Container Resource Allocation:**  Allocate sufficient CPU and memory to your Docker containers to ensure smooth performance, particularly if you're running demanding 3D printing software.

**Resources:**

* **Remmina:** [https://remmina.org/](https://remmina.org/)
* **Docker:** [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)
* **Proxmox Documentation:** [https://www.proxmox.com/](https://www.proxmox.com/)
* **Numerous Dockerfile Examples:** Search for Dockerfiles specifically designed for 3D printing software like PrusaSlicer or Cura.



To help me refine this recommendation further, could you tell me:

*   **Which OS are you most comfortable with, and will likely be using for your 3D printing workflow?** (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
*   **What 3D printing software are you planning to use?** (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura, Simplify3D)
*   **What's your level of experience with Docker and remote desktop clients?** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
