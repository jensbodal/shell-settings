⠙ ⠹ ⠹ Okay, let's break down the best containerized remote desktop environments for Proxmox, specifically geared towards managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations, keeping your preference for macOS in mind. You're aiming for central management and avoiding duplicated configurations – a smart move!

Here’s a breakdown of the top contenders, ranked with explanations for why they're good choices:

**1. Remmina + Docker (Recommended - Most Flexible & Feature-Rich)**

* **Why it’s great:** This combination offers the most flexibility and control, aligning perfectly with your goal.
* **How it works:**
    * **Remmina:** Remmina is a powerful, open-source remote desktop *connector*. It’s excellent at connecting to various protocols (RDP, VNC, SSH X11 forwarding, etc.) and letting you manage sessions efficiently.  It can be customized extensively.
    * **Docker Container:** You’ll create a Docker container that hosts your 3D printing slicer software (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura, Simplify3D). This container will be your central slicer environment.
    * **Proxmox Integration:**  You’ll run the Docker container on Proxmox.
* **Workflow:**
    1.  You launch Remmina from Proxmox.
    2.  Remmina connects to the running Docker container.
    3.  You use the slicer within the container, making changes.
    4.  Changes are saved *within* the container.
    5.  You can easily connect to the container from other devices via Remmina.
* **Pros:**
    * **Highly Customizable:** Remmina is extremely configurable.
    * **Protocol Choice:** You can choose the best protocol (RDP is often preferred for Windows, VNC for macOS/Linux)
    * **Container Isolation:** The container isolates the slicer software, preventing conflicts with your host OS.
    * **Persistence:** Changes are persistent within the container.
    * **Mature & Supported:**  Both Remmina and Docker are well-established and have large communities.
* **Cons:**
    * **More Setup:** It requires a slightly more complex setup compared to simpler solutions.  You'll need to understand Docker basics.


**2. TightVNC + Docker (Good Option, Especially for macOS/Linux)**

* **Why it’s good:** TightVNC is a lightweight, popular VNC server.
* **How it works:** Similar to Remmina + Docker, you’ll run a TightVNC server within a Docker container.
* **Workflow:** Remmina connects to the TightVNC server in the container.
* **Pros:**
    * **Lightweight:** TightVNC is fast and efficient.
    * **Good for macOS/Linux:** Generally performs very well on macOS and Linux.
    * **Simple to Set Up:** Relatively easy to get running.
* **Cons:**
    * **Less Feature-Rich:**  TightVNC has fewer features compared to Remmina.
    * **Can be Less Reliable:**  VNC can sometimes be less stable than RDP.


**3. Xrdp + Docker (Best for RDP - Preferred for Windows)**

* **Why it’s good:** Xrdp is a free RDP server. Since you prefer Windows for your slicing, this is a strong contender.
* **How it works:** You run an Xrdp server in a Docker container.
* **Workflow:** Remmina connects to the Xrdp server in the container.
* **Pros:**
    * **RDP Protocol:** Excellent compatibility with Windows clients (including Remmina).
    * **Good Performance:** RDP is generally very fast.
* **Cons:**
    * **Security Considerations:** RDP has historically been a target for attacks. You’ll need to properly configure security (strong passwords, network restrictions, etc.).

**4. TeamViewer (Not Recommended for Persistent Workflows)**

* **Why it's usually not ideal:** While easy to use, TeamViewer is *not* designed for persistent workflow management.  It’s primarily a remote access tool.  Changes aren’t automatically saved within the session.

**Docker Container Considerations (Important for All Options)**

* **Image Selection:** Start with a pre-built Docker image for your slicer software (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura). This will save you a lot of time.
* **Volume Mounting:** This is *crucial*.  You’ll need to mount a directory from your Proxmox host into the Docker container. This allows you to save your 3D printing profiles, configurations, and other data *persistently*, even when the container is restarted.
* **User Permissions:** Configure the user account within the container to have the necessary permissions to access the mounted volume.

**Recommendation & Setup Steps (Starting with Remmina + Docker - Best Overall)**

1. **Install Docker on Proxmox:** Follow the official Docker documentation for Proxmox.
2. **Create a Docker Container:**  Use the Docker command-line interface (CLI) or Docker Desktop to create a container for your slicer software.
3. **Mount a Volume:**  Add a volume mount to the container configuration. This is where you'll save your slicing data.
4. **Install Remmina:** Install Remmina on your Proxmox host.
5. **Connect with Remmina:**  Launch Remmina and connect to the running Docker container using the appropriate protocol (RDP, VNC, or SSH X11 forwarding).

**Resources:**

* **Docker Documentation:** [https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/)

* **PrusaSlicer Docker Image:** [https://hub.docker.com/r/prusa3d/prusaslicer/](https://hub.docker.com/r/prusa3d/prusaslicer/)  (Example – look for images for your slicer)

To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me:

*   Which 3D printer slicer software do you plan to use? (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura, Simplify3D)
*   What operating system are you primarily using on your Proxmox host? (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, Proxmox Web UI)
*   What is your comfort level with Docker and the command line?
