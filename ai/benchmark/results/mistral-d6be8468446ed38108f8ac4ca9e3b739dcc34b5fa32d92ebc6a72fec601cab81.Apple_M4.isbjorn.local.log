Now, let's translate the temperature 69°F to Celsius (in Norwegian):

English: 69 degrees Fahrenheit
Norwegian: 20,5 grader Celsius (rounded to one decimal place)

Here is a possible conversation in English about the image and the temperature conversion:

Person A: "Look at this delicious apple on the wooden table. It looks so fresh and juicy!"

Person B: "Yes, it certainly does! By the way, what's the temperature outside today?"

Person A: "It's 69 degrees Fahrenheit."

Person B: "Okay, let me convert that to Celsius for you. That would be around 20.5 degrees Celsius."

Person A: "Thank you! Now I know if I should wear a jacket or not when I go out."
