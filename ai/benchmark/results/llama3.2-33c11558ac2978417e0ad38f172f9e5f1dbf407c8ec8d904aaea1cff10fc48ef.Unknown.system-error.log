For a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox, I'd recommend considering the following options:

1. **Proxmox VE Apps**: Proxmox provides a built-in application center that allows you to easily install and manage containers. You can use the "VE Apps" section to search for pre-configured images for various applications, including remote desktop environments.
2. **Vultr's containerized RDP**: Vultr offers a managed cloud platform with pre-configured containerized RDP solutions. Their offerings are designed specifically for remote access and management of workstations, making it an excellent choice for your use case.

For the operating system, you have several options:

1. **macOS in a Linux-based container**: You can run macOS in a Linux-based container using tools like:
 * **Linuxbrew's Docker image**: This provides a headless macOS environment with a web-based login interface.
 * **Parallels Desktop for Linux**: This allows you to run a full-fledged macOS installation within a Linux container.

For 3D printing slicer configuration, consider the following options:

1. **Slic3r**: A popular open-source 3D printing slicer that can be run as a web application.
2. **Cura**: Another widely used 3D printing slicer that offers both GUI and command-line interfaces.

To avoid syncing configurations between machines, you can use the following strategies:

1. **Use a centralized configuration management tool**, such as:
 * **Ansible**: An open-source automation tool that can manage and deploy configurations to multiple environments.
 * **Puppet**: Another popular automation tool that offers robust configuration management capabilities.
2. **Store configurations in a version control system**, like Git, and use a **container-based workflow** to manage changes.

Here's an example of how you could set up your containerized remote desktop environment:

* Use Proxmox VE Apps or Vultr's containerized RDP solution as the base image.
* Install macOS (using Linuxbrew's Docker image or Parallels Desktop for Linux) or a similar operating system within a Linux-based container.
* Set up Slic3r or Cura as a web application within your remote desktop environment.
* Use Ansible or Puppet to manage and deploy configurations to your remote desktop environment.

By centralizing your workflows in a local remote desktop, you can avoid syncing configurations between machines and ensure that each machine has its own, isolated copy of the workflow.
