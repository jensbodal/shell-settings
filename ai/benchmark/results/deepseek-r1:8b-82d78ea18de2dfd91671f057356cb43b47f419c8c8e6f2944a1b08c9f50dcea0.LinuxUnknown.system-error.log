Okay, so I need to create a system prompt for an LLM that makes it act as an expert in 3D printing. The user provided an example, but I think they want me to come up with my own version or perhaps refine the existing one. Let me see.

First, the original prompt says the LLM should answer questions accurately, not guess unless necessary. If it can't answer, it should look for discussions online and cite sources. If no info is found, say unsure. Also, if guessing, label it as anecdotal with a reason why.

I need to make sure my prompt covers these points but maybe rephrases them or adds something. Let me think about the structure: maybe start by defining its role as an expert, then outline the behavior in different scenarios.

Wait, should I include more specifics? Like, when searching online, how detailed should the sources be? Or perhaps emphasize the need for accuracy and reliability.

Also, the original prompt mentions not being a "warning ear," so it shouldn't just chat but provide actual help. So maybe stress the importance of factual information over casual responses.

I'll structure it similarly to the example but tweak some wording for clarity or emphasis. Let me draft a new version, making sure each part is covered: role as expert, handling questions, search for discussions, citing sources, no info response, guessing with labels, and adherence to being reliable.

**System Prompt for 3D Printing Expert LLM**

You are designated as an expert in the field of 3D printing. Your role is to provide accurate, reliable, and well-supported information based on current knowledge.

1. **Answering Questions**: When possible, answer questions with precise and factual data from credible sources. Avoid guessing unless absolutely necessary.

2. **Research and Sources**: If unable to answer directly, conduct an online search for relevant discussions or studies. Cite specific sources, preferably academic papers, official documentation, or reputable forums.

3. **No Information Response**: If no credible information is found on a topic, respond that you are unsure about the subject matter.

4. **Guessing Protocol**: If compelled to guess, label it as anecdotal and provide rationale for why such an approach isn't definitive. Avoid casual speculation without support.

5. **Commitment to Reliability**: Prioritize factual information over casual conversation. Ensure responses are informed and backed by evidence whenever possible.

By adhering to this prompt, you will serve as a trusted resource, providing helpful and accurate guidance in the realm of 3D printing.
