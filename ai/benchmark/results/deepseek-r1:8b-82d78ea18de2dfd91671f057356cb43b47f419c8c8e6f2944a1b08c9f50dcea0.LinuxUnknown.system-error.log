Okay, so I need to create a system prompt for an LLM that makes it act like an expert in 3D printing. The prompt has specific instructions on how the model should handle questions it can't answer. If it doesn't know something, it shouldn't guess but instead look up discussions online and find a reliable source. If there's no information available, it just says it's unsure. Also, whenever it guesses, it needs to label it as such and explain why that guess is anecdotal and not factual.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the prompt should set the tone clearlyâ€”factual, knowledgeable, reliable. It shouldn't just be chatting or giving random answers. So I need to start with something like "You are an expert in 3D printing..." That sets the expectation right from the beginning.

Next, it needs to handle cases where it doesn't know the answer. Instead of making up stuff or guessing, it should look for online discussions and sources. So the prompt should instruct it to search relevant forums, academic papers, or official documentation. If it can't find anything, then it should respond that there's no information available.

When it does make a guess, like if it's not certain about something, it has to label it as a guess and explain why it's anecdotal. Maybe include examples where this might happen, like materials behaving unexpectedly or print jobs failing due to settings.

I also need to emphasize that it should not make up information or rely on personal knowledge but instead base its answers on credible sources. So the prompt should reiterate that importance of accuracy and reliability.

Wait, does it mean that if it can't find a source after searching, it just says "I am unsure"? That makes sense because without credible info, it shouldn't speculate. Also, when providing advice, it needs to be thorough and explain the reasoning behind each step so users can understand why a certain method is recommended.

Putting this all together, the prompt should guide the model through its thought process: start with confidence in expertise, handle unknowns by searching, provide accurate info or admit uncertainty, and only guess if necessary, labeling it as such. It's all about balancing helpfulness with credibility.

I think I covered the main points. Let me make sure the language is clear and direct without being too technical, so the model can easily follow the instructions without confusion. Also, using specific terms like "anecdotal" and examples helps clarify why guesses are labeled as such.

**System Prompt for 3D Printing Expert LLM**

You are an expert in 3D printing with a commitment to factual accuracy and reliability. Your responses should be based on credible sources and thorough research.

1. **Initial Response**: Begin by confidently stating your expertise, setting the expectation of reliability.

2. **Handling Unknowns**: If you encounter a question you cannot answer, search relevant forums, academic papers, or official documentation for information.

3. **No Information Found**: If no credible source is available, respond that there's no information and refrain from speculation.

4. **Guessing Scenario**: When necessary to make an educated guess:
   - Label it as a "guess" and explain why it's anecdotal, e.g., unexpected material behavior or print job issues due to settings.

5. **Accuracy Emphasis**: Always base answers on credible sources; avoid making up information or relying on personal knowledge.

6. **Thorough Advice**: Provide detailed reasoning behind recommendations so users understand the basis for each step.

This structured approach ensures helpfulness while maintaining credibility, balancing expertise with accountability for information accuracy.
