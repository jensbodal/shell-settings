Okay, the user wants to set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox to manage persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. They prefer macOS but are open to Linux or Windows. The main goal is to avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing the workflow locally via a remote desktop.

First, I need to figure out what containerized remote desktop solutions are available. Proxmox supports LXC and KVM. Since they mentioned containerized, probably LXC is the way to go. But wait, remote desktop environments typically require a full OS, so maybe they mean using containers to run the desktop environment? Or maybe they want a containerized RDP or VNC server?

Wait, maybe they're looking for a way to run a desktop environment in a container on Proxmox, which can be accessed remotely. But containers aren't the best for GUI apps. So perhaps they want to run a VM in a container? Or maybe use a containerized desktop environment like X11 forwarding, but that's not exactly a remote desktop.

Alternatively, maybe they want to use a containerized RDP server or something similar. But that might not be straightforward. Let me think.

Another angle: the user wants to centralize workflows, so they need a persistent environment where they can configure slicers (like Cura, Slic3r, etc.) and not have to sync files between machines. So the remote desktop environment should have all those tools installed, and the user can access it from any machine.

But how to run that in a container on Proxmox. Proxmox's LXC containers can run full OSes, but they need to be compatible. For example, if they want macOS, but macOS isn't available as a container. So maybe they can't run macOS in a container. So perhaps they need to use a VM instead of a container. Wait, but the user said "containerized remote desktop environment". Maybe they meant using a container to run a remote desktop service, like a VNC server or RDP server, but that's a bit different.

Alternatively, maybe they want to run a Linux VM in a container? No, that doesn't make sense. Containers are lightweight, but they can't run full OSes. So maybe the user is conflating containers with VMs. So perhaps they should be using a VM for the remote desktop, and the question is about which VM setup is best for their needs.

Wait, the user says "containerized remote desktop environment". Maybe they are referring to using a containerized solution like a Docker container that provides a remote desktop experience. But Docker containers can't run GUI apps directly. However, there are projects like VNC, X11 forwarding, or using something like X11 over SSH, but that's not a full remote desktop.

Alternatively, maybe they are thinking of running a remote desktop server in a container. For example, using a container with a VNC server, and then accessing that via a remote desktop client. But that would be a lightweight setup, but the user might need a more full-featured environment.

Let me consider the options:

1. macOS: Since macOS is not available in containers, the user would need to run a macOS VM. But Proxmox supports KVM for VMs. However, macOS has licensing restrictions, so they can't just run it in a VM without an Apple Developer account and some workarounds. Also, macOS might not be the best choice for 3D printing slicers, which are more commonly used on Linux or Windows.

2. Linux: Running a Linux VM in Proxmox. They can install a desktop environment, like GNOME or KDE, and have the slicer software installed. Since Linux is more compatible with containerization, maybe using a container to run the slicer tools, but the user wants a persistent remote desktop environment. So maybe using a VM with a full desktop and then accessing it via RDP or VNC.

3. Windows: Similar to macOS, but Windows can be run in a VM. However, Windows licensing might be an issue, and again, the user might prefer Linux for the slicers.

Wait, the user wants to centralize the workflow. So they need a persistent environment where they can configure slicers and have all the settings saved. So the remote desktop environment needs to be persistent, not ephemeral. So using a VM in Proxmox with a persistent disk, and then accessing that via RDP or VNC.

But the user mentioned "containerized". Maybe they are confused between containers and VMs. Proxmox can run both, but containers are more lightweight. However, for a full desktop environment, a VM is more appropriate.

So perhaps the user is looking for a VM-based remote desktop solution on Proxmox, and the term "containerized" is a misunderstanding. But assuming they want a container-based approach, maybe using a container with a lightweight desktop environment and some tools.

Alternatively, maybe they want to use a container to run a remote desktop server. For example, using a Docker container with a VNC server, and then access that via a remote desktop client. But that would be a very minimal setup, and not suitable for complex workflows like 3D printing slicers, which require more resources and GUI access.

In that case, the best approach would be to run a VM in Proxmox with a full OS (like Linux or Windows) and then access it via RDP or VNC. For macOS, it's possible but with restrictions, but perhaps not ideal.

So, considering the options:

- For macOS: Use a macOS VM (with Apple's licensing), but it's complicated and may not be the best for 3D printing. Also, Proxmox can run macOS VMs, but they need to be configured properly.

- For Linux: Run a Linux VM with a desktop environment and install the slicer tools. This is more straightforward and compatible with Proxmox. They can use VNC or RDP to access it. For example, using VirtualBox or Proxmox's KVM with a VM.

- For Windows: Similar to Linux, but Windows might be more resource-heavy. However, some slicers are available on Windows.

But the user mentioned "containerized remote desktop environment". Maybe they are looking for a way to run a remote desktop service in a container, but that's not the standard approach. Alternatively, they might be referring to using a container to run the slicer tools, but that's not a remote desktop.

Wait, maybe they want to use a container to run the slicer software, and have that accessible via a web interface or something. But the question is about a remote desktop environment.

So perhaps the user is mistaken about "containerized" and actually needs a VM-based solution. If that's the case, then the best approach is to run a Linux VM (since macOS is more complicated and Windows may not be ideal for slicers), with a desktop environment and the necessary tools installed, and then access it via RDP or VNC.

In terms of remote desktop protocols, RDP is more common for Windows, but there are RDP clients for Linux. VNC is also an option. Alternatively, using something like NoVNC with a web interface, but that's more complex.

Another consideration is persistence. The VM should have persistent storage, so that configurations are saved between sessions.

So, summarizing, the best options would be:

1. Run a Linux VM on Proxmox with a desktop environment and slicer software installed. Access via VNC or RDP.

2. For macOS, use a macOS VM (with Apple's licensing), but it's more complex and may not be the best fit.

3. For Windows, similar to Linux, but again, licensing and resource considerations.

So the user might prefer Linux for the slicers. Therefore, the best containerized (or VM-based) solution would be a Linux VM with a desktop environment, and access via remote desktop. Since they mentioned "containerized", maybe they meant using a container for the remote desktop service, but that's not standard. Therefore, the answer should clarify that while Proxmox can run containers, for a full remote desktop environment, a VM is more appropriate, and recommend using a Linux VM with a desktop and the necessary tools.

To achieve a **persistent remote desktop environment** on **Proxmox** for managing workflows like **3D printing slicer configuration**, the best approach involves using **VMs (KVM)** rather than containers, as full desktop environments require a complete OS. However, if you're looking for a **containerized solution** (e.g., lightweight, isolated services), the answer depends on your OS preference and workflow needs. Here's a structured breakdown:

---

### **1. macOS (Preferred, but with Limitations)**
- **Pros**: Native macOS for some slicers (e.g., **Cura**), user-friendly interface.
- **Cons**:
  - **Licensing**: macOS cannot be run in a VM without Apple Developer licenses (via **Boot Camp** or **Rosetta 2** workarounds).
  **Proxmox Limitations**: macOS VMs are possible but require **macOS Sierra or later** and **Intel-based hardware** (ARM not supported).
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Use **macOS VMs** if you have Apple licenses. Access via **RDP** or **VNC** (via third-party tools like **TigerVNC** or **RealVNC**).
  - **Not ideal** for 3D printing workflows due to licensing and compatibility issues.

---

### **2. Linux (Best for Persistence and Slicer Compatibility)**
- **Pros**:
  - **No licensing issues**.
  - **Slicers like Cura (Linux version)**, **Slic3r**, and **Kirigami** are natively supported.
  - **Persistent storage** via Proxmox LVM or ZFS.
- **Remote Access**:
  - **RDP**: Use **xrdp** (open-source) or **Remmina** (GNOME-based) for Linux VMs.
  - **VNC**: Install **TigerVNC** or **tightvnc** for lightweight access.
  - **Web-based**: Use **NoVNC** with **x11vnc** for browser access.
- **Containerized Services**:
  - Run **Docker containers** for **slicer tools** (e.g., **Slic3r** via Docker) or **web-based interfaces** (e.g., **OctoPrint**), but **not for full desktop environments**.
- **Best Practice**: 
  - Create a **Linux VM** with a desktop environment (e.g., **GNOME** or **KDE**) and install slicers.
  - Use **RDP** or **VNC** for remote access, ensuring persistent storage.

---

### **3. Windows (Alternative for Slicer Compatibility)**
- **Pros**:
  - **Slicers like Cura (Windows version)**, **PrusaSlicer**, and **Slic3r** are available.
  - **RDP** is native for Windows VMs.
- **Cons**:
  - **Licensing**: Windows VMs require valid licenses.
  - **Resource-heavy** compared to Linux.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Use **Windows VMs** for workflows requiring Windows-specific tools.
  - Access via **RDP** (e.g., **Microsoft Remote Desktop** or **Remmina**).

---

### **4. Containerized Remote Desktop (Advanced Use Case)**
If you truly want a **containerized** solution (not VM-based), consider:
- **Docker + VNC**: Run a lightweight VNC server (e.g., **Tigervnc** or **X11vnc**) in a container and access it via a remote client.
- **Web-based Tools**: Use **OctoPrint** (web-based) for 3D printing workflows, but this is not a full desktop environment.
- **Limitations**: Containers cannot run full GUI desktops without host integration (e.g., **X11 forwarding**), which is not ideal for persistent workflows.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
**Linux VM with Remote Desktop Access** is the most practical solution:
- **Setup**:
  - Create a **Linux VM** (e.g., Ubuntu/Debian) in Proxmox.
  - Install a desktop environment (e.g., GNOME).
  - Install 3D printing slicers (e.g., **Slic3r**, **Cura**).
  - Configure **RDP** (via **xrdp**) or **VNC** for remote access.
- **Persistence**: Use **Proxmox’s LVM** or **ZFS** for persistent storage.
- **Centralized Workflow**: All configurations are stored within the VM, avoiding sync between machines.

---

### **Summary**
- **macOS**: Possible but limited by licensing; not ideal for slicers.
- **Linux**: **Best choice** for persistent workflows, slicer compatibility, and remote access.
- **Windows**: Alternative for Windows-specific slicers, but less efficient.
- **Containerized**: Not suitable for full desktop environments; use VMs instead.

**Answer**: Use a **Linux VM** in Proxmox with a desktop environment and slicer tools, accessed via **RDP** or **VNC** for persistent, centralized workflow management. macOS is not recommended due to licensing and compatibility issues.
