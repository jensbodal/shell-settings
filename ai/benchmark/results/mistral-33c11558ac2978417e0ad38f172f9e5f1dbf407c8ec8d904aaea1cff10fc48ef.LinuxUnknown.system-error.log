 To achieve your goals of creating a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that supports persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration with MacOS (preferred), Linux, or Windows, you can consider using a combination of LXC containers for the operating system and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Virtual Network Computing (VNC) for remote access.

   Here's a step-by-step guide for setting up a MacOS LXC container on Proxmox with RDP access:

1. Install MacStadium's Mac in Cloud (MiC) on your Proxmox server. MiC is a preconfigured, easy-to-deploy virtual machine that runs macOS High Sierra or later. You can follow the official instructions to set up MacStadium's MiC on Proxmox: https://docs.macstadium.com/getting_started/proxmox

2. Create an LXC container for your Proxmox host to run the MiC VM. Follow this guide for setting up and configuring an LXC container on Proxmox: https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-create-an-lxc-container

3. Share necessary folders between your host system (running the LXC container) and the MiC VM, so you can easily access your 3D printing slicer configurations without having to sync them between machines. You can use NFS or SMB/Samba for this purpose: https://www.proxmox.com/wiki/Index:Share_NFS (for NFS) and https://www.proxmox.com/wiki/Shared_Folders (for SMB/Samba).

4. Configure the MiC VM to allow RDP access by following this guide: https://docs.macstadium.com/howto/rdp-access-on-mic

5. Install an RDP client on your host system, such as Remmina (Linux) or Microsoft Remote Desktop (Windows), and connect to the MiC VM using the RDP credentials you configured earlier.

   If macOS isn't preferable for you, you can set up similar containerized environments with Linux or Windows, using appropriate virtualization technologies like VirtualBox or VMware on your Proxmox host. Ensure that you configure shared folders and RDP/VNC access accordingly to meet your requirements.
