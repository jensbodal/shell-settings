**7.  (Optional)  Resources & Links (1-2 Sentences)**

*   **Prompt:** "Please provide links to the official documentation, tutorials, and code examples for both [Tool/Library/Framework Name] and [Alternative Tool/Library/Framework Name]."


**Important Considerations & Customization:**

*   **Specificity:** The more specific you are, the better the results. Vague prompts yield vague comparisons.
*   **Context is Key:** Tailor the prompt to your *specific* needs. What's your focus? What problem are you trying to solve?
*   **Iterate:** Don't expect perfect results on the first try.  Review the generated responses and refine the prompt based on what you need.
*   **Provide Constraints (Optional):**  You could add constraints like "Focus on [Specific Aspects]" to help guide the comparison.

To help me refine this prompt further, could you tell me:

*   What type of comparison are you doing (e.g., feature-by-feature, performance-focused, usability-focused)?
*   What is the primary use case you are concerned with?
