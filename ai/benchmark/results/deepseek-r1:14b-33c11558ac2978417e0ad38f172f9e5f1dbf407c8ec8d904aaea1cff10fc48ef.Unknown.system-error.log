Okay, so I need to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to run on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. I prefer macOS but am open to Linux or Windows as well. The main goal is to avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing everything in a local remote desktop.

First, let me break down the problem. I want to set up a remote desktop that's containerized on Proxmox. Containers are great because they provide an isolated environment and can be easily managed. Proxmox itself uses LXC containers, so maybe sticking with those would be ideal since they integrate well with the platform.

I need this setup to handle persistent workflows, specifically 3D printing slicer configurations. That means whatever environment I set up should allow me to save and access these configurations without having to sync them across different machines. So centralizing everything in one place is key.

Since I prefer macOS, but am open to alternatives, I should consider whether running macOS in a container is feasible. I know that macOS can't be run natively on non-Apple hardware due to System Integrity Protection (SIP) and other security features. However, maybe there's a way to run a Linux-based environment with macOS-like tools or even use a virtual machine for macOS if needed.

Wait, the user mentioned containerized, so virtual machines might not be ideal unless they're using something like Proxmox's built-in support for VMs, but I think containers are more lightweight and suitable here. So focusing on containers that can run either Linux or Windows with tools that mimic macOS if necessary.

Let me consider each part of the solution:

1. **Containerization**: Using LXC (Linux Containers) since they're natively supported by Proxmox. Docker might be an option, but I think LXC is more integrated for a seamless experience on Proxmox.

2. **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**: To access the containerized environment remotely, RDP seems like a solid choice because it's widely supported and works well across different operating systems. Alternatively, VNC could be an option, but I think RDP is more reliable for persistent connections.

3. **Persistent Storage**: Since workflows need to be persistent, the container should have access to a shared storage volume that isn't lost when the container restarts or is recreated. Proxmox allows for ZFS pools and can configure volumes, so setting up a ZFS dataset as a container root would ensure persistence.

4. **Environment Customization**: If using Linux containers, I might want to customize the environment with necessary tools like a 3D printing slicer software (e.g., Cura). Maybe even set up a desktop environment within the container for easier remote access and management of these workflows.

5. **Access from macOS**: To access the RDP server running in a Proxmox container, I can use free tools like Chicken VNC or commercial options like AnyDesk. However, native RDP clients on macOS might not be as seamless, so maybe using something like Remotix or Cogmentive would work better.

Putting this all together, here's the plan:

- **Set up an LXC container** on Proxmox with a Linux distribution (Ubuntu/Debian might be easiest).
- **Install a remote desktop service** in the container, such as VNC or xrdp.
- **Mount a persistent volume** to store workflow configurations and software (like Cura) so they persist across reboots.
- **Access the RDP server from macOS** using an appropriate client that provides a good user experience.

I need to ensure that the container's environment is set up correctly, with all necessary tools and configurations. Also, security considerations are important—ensuring that remote access is secure, possibly through SSH tunneling if RDP isn't directly exposed on the network.

Another thought: maybe using a headless desktop environment would be more efficient, especially since I don't need a graphical interface but rather want to manage workflows remotely. However, for slicer configuration, having a GUI might still be necessary, so providing access through remote desktop is essential.

In summary, the setup should involve creating an LXC container with a Linux OS, enabling RDP access, attaching persistent storage, and then accessing it from macOS using compatible RDP tools.

To set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing 3D printing workflows, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Create an LXC Container on Proxmox:**
   - Log into the Proxmox web interface.
   - Navigate to "Nodes" > your node name > "Containers."
   - Click "Add" and select "Container (LXC)."
   - Configure the container settings:
     - Name: e.g., `3D-Printing-Environment`
     - Hostname: e.g., `3dprinting.local`
     - Rootfs: Choose a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu or Debian.
     - For persistent storage, select an existing ZFS dataset or create a new one.

2. **Start the Container and Access it:**
   - Start the newly created container via the Proxmox web interface.
   - Once running, access the console to install necessary software.

3. **Install Remote Desktop Service (RDP) in the Container:**
   - Install `xrdp` for RDP support:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     sudo apt install xrdp -y
     ```
   - Start and enable the xrdp service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start xrdp
     sudo systemctl enable xrdp
     ```

4. **Mount Persistent Storage:**
   - Create a ZFS dataset in Proxmox for persistent storage (if not already done).
   - Attach this volume to your container under "Volumes" in the container settings.
   - This ensures that all workflow configurations and software persist across reboots.

5. **Install Necessary Software and Tools:**
   - Install Cura or other 3D printing slicer software.
     ```bash
     sudo apt install cura-ideamaker -y
     ```
   - Optionally, set up a desktop environment if needed for GUI access:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop -y
     ```

6. **Secure Remote Access:**
   - Use an SSH tunnel to securely access the RDP server.
     ```bash
     ssh -L 3389:localhost:3389 user@pve-server
     ```
   - This forwards port 3389 (RDP) through your SSH session.

7. **Access from macOS:**
   - Use an RDP client compatible with macOS, such as:
     - **Remotix**: A feature-rich RDP client.
     - **AnyDesk**: Cross-platform remote desktop solution.
     - **Chicken VNC**: Alternative if VNC is preferred over RDP.

### Summary

By setting up an LXC container on Proxmox with a Linux distribution, enabling RDP access, and attaching persistent storage, you create a centralized environment for managing 3D printing workflows. Accessing this from macOS via an RDP client allows efficient management without needing to sync configurations across devices. This setup ensures persistence, ease of access, and security.
