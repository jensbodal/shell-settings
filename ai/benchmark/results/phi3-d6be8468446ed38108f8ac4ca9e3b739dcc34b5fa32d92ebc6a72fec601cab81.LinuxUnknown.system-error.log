- 69° Fahrenheit (20° Celsius) is typically translated into Norwegian as "syklon" when referring to temperature, hence in C scale it would be approximately -18°C (-0.4°F). However, temperatures are generally not converted between scales in this manner because the context does not usually require such conversions for everyday use; instead, we might say 20°C as is understood universally across various English-speaking regions to a Norwegian audience.

In terms of conversation:

Person A (English): "Would you like some apple pie after dinner tonight?"

Person B (Norwegian): "Ja, vær så snill å se de sørge! Til og med!" ("Yes, please do that right away! See you and have a good time too!") 

Note: The specific conversion between English to Norwegian for the temperature would not typically occur in this informal exchange. Instead, Person B uses colloquial expressions common among Norwegians who often refer directly to Celsius temperatures without translation or conversions when discussing weather conditions casually with friends and family.
