Okay, the user wants the best containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. They prefer macOS but are open to Linux or Windows. The main goal is to avoid syncing configs between machines by centralizing the workflow locally.

First, I need to think about containerized remote desktop solutions. Proxmox uses LXC and KVM, so the container should be compatible with those. Let me recall the options.

VirtualBox can be used with Proxmox, but it's not containerized. Maybe not the best fit. Then there's the option of using a containerized desktop environment. I remember that there's a project called "Linux Containers with X11" but that's more for running apps, not full desktops.

Wait, there's a project called "X11 forwarding" which allows running a GUI app inside a container. But that's not a full desktop environment. The user wants a full remote desktop experience, so maybe a container with a full desktop OS.

Hmm, maybe using a container that runs a desktop environment. But containers are lightweight, and running a full desktop might be resource-heavy. However, Proxmox can handle that.

Alternatively, using a VM inside a container? That seems complicated. Maybe not. Another approach is to use a container that runs a remote desktop server, like X11 or VNC, and then connect to it.

Wait, there's a project called "Tailscale" or "ZeroTier" for networking, but that's not directly relevant. Let me think about specific tools.

For macOS, there's a container that runs macOS. But macOS isn't open-source, and running it in a container might be tricky. Plus, Apple's licensing might restrict that. So maybe not the best route.

Alternatively, using a Linux container with a desktop environment. For example, using a container with GNOME or XFCE. Then, connecting via VNC or RDP. But the user wants a remote desktop environment, so maybe they need a full desktop session.

Wait, there's a tool called "Docker Desktop" which allows running Windows or macOS in containers, but that requires specific setup. However, Proxmox might not support that directly. Also, macOS in a container might be against Apple's terms of service.

So maybe the user is okay with Linux or Windows. Let's focus on those. For Linux, using a container with a desktop environment. For example, using a container image that includes a desktop, like a minimal Ubuntu with GNOME, then exposing VNC or RDP.

But how to make it persistent? Containers can have persistent storage by mounting volumes. So the user can have their workflow configurations stored in a volume, making them persistent across container restarts.

Another option is to use a containerized remote desktop server. For example, using a container with xrdp or tigervnc. Then, the user can connect via RDP or VNC to the container, which runs a desktop environment.

But setting up a full desktop environment in a container might be resource-intensive. However, Proxmox can handle that if the host has enough resources.

Alternatively, using a lightweight container with a desktop. Maybe using a minimal Linux distro like Alpine Linux, but Alpine doesn't have a desktop by default. So you'd need to install a desktop environment, which might take up more space.

Wait, there's a project called "LXD" which is a container manager, and maybe there's a way to run a desktop in LXD. But again, the same issues apply.

Another thought: maybe use a VM inside Proxmox, but the user specifically mentioned containerized. So VMs are out of the question.

So, considering all that, the best options are:

1. For macOS: Not really feasible in a container due to licensing and technical restrictions. However, maybe using a macOS VM, but that's not containerized. The user might have to accept that, but they wanted a container.

2. For Linux: Use a container with a desktop environment, using VNC or RDP. For example, using a container like "linuxserver/ovpn" but adapted for desktop. Wait, maybe there's a specific image for this.

Alternatively, using a container with a full desktop, like the "x11vnc" server. But that's for sharing a desktop, not running a full session.

Wait, there's a project called "VNC4Server" that can run a desktop inside a container. But again, setting that up might be complex.

Alternatively, using a container that runs a remote desktop server, like xrdp, and then have a minimal Linux desktop environment inside. For example, using a container with Ubuntu, installing GNOME or XFCE, and then setting up xrdp to allow RDP connections.

That could work. The user can then connect to the container via RDP, and have their 3D printing slicer running there. The configuration would be stored in the container's persistent volume, so no syncing needed.

For macOS, if the user insists, maybe using a virtual machine with macOS, but that's not containerized. However, if they're okay with a VM, then maybe that's the way, but the user specified containerized.

So, the best options would be:

- For Linux: Container with a desktop environment and RDP/VNC server, using persistent storage.

- For Windows: A container with Windows, but that's not possible with standard containers. However, there's Windows containers, but they're more for running Windows apps, not full desktops. Maybe using a Windows container with a desktop, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, Windows containers can run GUI apps if you use the /host switch, but that's not a full desktop. So maybe not suitable.

Therefore, the best bet is to use a Linux container with a desktop environment. For example, using a container image like "ubuntu-desktop" from Docker Hub, then setting up VNC or RDP to access it. The user can then have persistent storage by mounting a volume.

Alternatively, using Proxmox's LXC containers with a desktop environment. For example, creating an LXC container with Ubuntu, installing GNOME, and then setting up VNC or RDP.

But setting up RDP in a container might require some configuration. For example, installing xrdp and then allowing RDP connections.

Another consideration is the user's need for persistence. Containers can have persistent storage via volumes, so the 3D printing slicer configuration would be stored there, not on the host.

So, putting it all together, the best approach is to use a Linux container with a desktop environment and a remote desktop server (like VNC or RDP), mounted with persistent storage. For macOS, it's not feasible in a container, so the user might have to use a VM, but that's not containerized. Alternatively, use a macOS VM with Proxmox's KVM, but that's not containerized.

Therefore, the answer would recommend using a Linux container with a desktop environment and remote desktop server, with persistent storage. Maybe using Docker or LXC, and suggest specific images or setups.

To achieve a **containerized remote desktop environment** on **Proxmox** for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, here's a structured approach:

---

### **Best Containerized Remote Desktop Solution for Proxmox**
#### **1. Linux Container (Recommended)**
**Why Linux?**  
- **Cost-effective** and avoids macOS licensing/technical restrictions.  
- **Lightweight** and easier to containerize compared to macOS.  
- **Persistent storage** via volumes simplifies workflow management.

**Recommended Tools/Setup:**
- **Container Runtime:** Use **LXC (Proxmox's default)** or **Docker** (via Proxmox's Docker container).  
- **Desktop Environment:** Use a lightweight desktop like **XFCE** or **GNOME** for better performance.  
- **Remote Access:** Use **VNC** or **RDP** to access the desktop.  

**Step-by-Step Setup:**
1. **Create a Linux Container:**
   - Use a base image like **Ubuntu** or **Debian** with a desktop environment (e.g., `ubuntu-desktop` image from Docker Hub).
   - Example Dockerfile for a minimal setup:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM ubuntu:20.04
     RUN apt update && apt install -y xfce4 xfce4-terminal x11vnc
     CMD ["x11vnc", "-shared", "-create"]
     ```
   - Alternatively, use a pre-built image like [https://hub.docker.com/r/xfce4/xfce4](https://hub.docker.com/r/xfce4/xfce4).

2. **Expose Remote Access:**
   - **VNC:** Use `x11vnc` to create a VNC server. Connect with a VNC client (e.g., **TightVNC** or **RealVNC**).
   - **RDP:** Install **xrdp** and configure it to allow RDP connections (e.g., using `xrdp` in a container with a GUI).

3. **Persistent Storage:**
   - Mount a **Proxmox volume** to the container to store slicer configurations and workflows. Example:
     ```bash
     docker run -v /mnt/data:/home/user/configs -d your-image
     ```

4. **Access the Desktop:**
   - Connect via VNC/RDP to the container's IP address (e.g., `vnc://<container-ip>:5900` or `rdp://<container-ip>`).

**Pros:**
- **Lightweight** and easy to manage.
- **Persistent storage** ensures workflow configs are centralized.
- **No syncing** between machines.

**Cons:**
- Requires manual setup of desktop environments and remote access tools.

---

#### **2. macOS in a Container (Not Recommended)**
**Challenges:**
- **Licensing:** Apple restricts macOS from running in containers or virtual machines.  
- **Technical Limitations:** macOS cannot be containerized natively on Proxmox (LXC/KVM).  
- **Workarounds:** Use a **macOS VM** (e.g., via Parallels or VMware) on Proxmox, but this is not containerized and may not meet your "containerized" requirement.

**Alternative:** If macOS is a strict requirement, consider:
- **Remote Desktop to a macOS VM:** Use Proxmox's KVM to run a macOS VM, then connect via **Screen Sharing** or **RDP/VNC**. However, this is not containerized and may lack persistence unless configured with shared storage.

---

#### **3. Windows in a Container (Not Recommended)**
- **Windows containers** are limited to running Windows apps, not full desktops.  
- **RDP** in a Windows container requires complex setup and is not ideal for persistent workflows.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
**Best Option:**  
Use a **Linux container** with a lightweight desktop environment (e.g., XFCE) and **VNC/RDP** for remote access. This setup is **cost-effective**, **persistent**, and fully compatible with Proxmox.

**Example Workflow:**
- **Container:** Ubuntu with XFCE and x11vnc.
- **Persistent Storage:** Mount a Proxmox volume for slicer config files.
- **Access:** Connect via VNC client to the container's IP.

**Why This Works:**
- Centralizes workflows without syncing.
- Ensures persistent configurations.
- Avoids macOS licensing issues.

---

### **Summary**
- **Linux Container (LXC/Docker):** Best for cost, persistence, and ease of setup.
- **macOS/Windows:** Not feasible in containers; use VMs if needed, but they lack containerization.
- **Key Tools:** x11vnc, xrdp, Docker, and Proxmox volumes for persistence.

This approach balances **containerization**, **persistence**, and **remote access** for managing 3D printing workflows.
