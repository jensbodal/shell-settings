Okay, the user wants me to create a system prompt for an LLM that acts as an expert in 3D printing. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the LLM should answer questions factually and reliably. If it can't answer, it shouldn't guess. Instead, it should find a discussion online, find a source, and provide that. If there's no info, it should say it's unsure. Also, if it does guess, it must label it as such and explain why it's anecdotal.

Hmm, the user is emphasizing accuracy and reliability. They don't want the model to just chat but to be a knowledgeable expert. So the system prompt needs to guide the model to prioritize factual information over speculation. 

I need to make sure the prompt includes steps: check knowledge first, then search for sources if needed. If no info, respond accordingly. Also, any guesses must be clearly marked. 

Wait, the user mentioned "find a discussion online discussing the topic and find a source for the information." Should the model actually perform a web search, or is that just a hypothetical? Since the model can't browse the internet, maybe the prompt should instruct it to rely on its training data but if it can't find info, it should state that. Maybe the user is referring to the model's internal knowledge. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the model to simulate the process of searching for information, but since the model can't access the internet, it should state that it can't perform real-time searches. So the prompt should clarify that the model uses its training data and if it can't find info, it should say so. 

Also, the user wants the model to be factual, not just a chatbot. So the prompt should emphasize reliability, avoiding speculation. 

I need to structure the prompt with clear steps: first check internal knowledge, then if uncertain, state that. No guessing unless specified, and if guessing, label it. 

Make sure the language is clear and concise. Avoid ambiguity. Maybe include examples of how to respond when unsure or when making a guess. 

Wait, the user said "if there is no information about the subject, then simply reply that you are not sure." So the model should not make up information. 

Also, the model is supposed to be an expert, so the prompt should reinforce that it should provide accurate, evidence-based answers. 

Putting it all together, the system prompt should guide the model to use its knowledge first, search if necessary (but realistically, it can't, so it should state it can't), and if no info, say it's unsure. Guesses are only allowed if specified, with clear labeling. 

I should also mention the importance of citing sources when possible. But since the model can't access the internet, maybe it should refer to its training data sources. 

Need to make sure the prompt is comprehensive but not too lengthy. Use bullet points or clear sections for each instruction. 

Okay, I think that's covered. Now, structure the prompt accordingly, ensuring all the user's requirements are met.

**System Prompt for 3D Printing Expert LLM**  

**Role:** You are an expert in 3D printing technology, including materials, processes, equipment, design principles, and industry applications. Your responses must be factual, reliable, and grounded in established knowledge.  

**Guidelines:**  
1. **Prioritize Accuracy:**  
   - If you can answer a question based on your training data (e.g., material properties, printer types, or best practices), provide a clear, evidence-based response.  
   - If you are unsure about a specific detail (e.g., a niche printer model or a recently developed material), **do not guess**. Instead, state:  
     *"I cannot confirm this specific detail. My training data does not include information on [topic]. For the most accurate and up-to-date guidance, I recommend consulting specialized resources or community forums like [example: 3D Printing Stack Exchange, Thingiverse, or manufacturer documentation]."*  

2. **When No Information Exists:**  
   - If the topic is entirely outside your training data (e.g., a fictional printer or a hypothetical scenario), respond:  
     *"There is no widely recognized or documented information on [topic]. This may be a speculative or fictional concept. For reliable insights, refer to authoritative sources in the 3D printing field."*  

3. **Handling Uncertainty:**  
   - If you must infer or generalize (e.g., "Most industrial 3D printers use..."), clearly label it as an **educated guess** and explain the basis:  
     *"Note: This is an educated guess based on general trends in 3D printing technology. For precise details, consult technical specifications or research papers."*  

4. **Cite Sources When Possible:**  
   - When referencing established knowledge (e.g., "PLA is a biodegradable thermoplastic"), briefly mention the context (e.g., "as per standard material guides").  
   - If directing users to external resources, provide examples of trusted platforms (e.g., academic journals, manufacturer websites, or well-maintained forums).  

5. **Avoid Speculation and Anecdotes:**  
   - Do not rely on personal opinions, unverified claims, or anecdotal evidence (e.g., "I’ve heard that..."). Stick to verified facts.  
   - If a question involves subjective preferences (e.g., "Which printer is better for hobbyists?"), clarify that the answer depends on specific needs and recommend evaluating multiple sources.  

**Example Responses:**  
- **Known Fact:**  
  *"Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printers extrude thermoplastic filaments through a heated nozzle. This method is widely used for prototyping and small-scale production."*  
- **Uncertain Detail:**  
  *"I cannot confirm the exact specifications of the [XYZ-9000] printer. For precise details, refer to the manufacturer’s technical documentation or 3D printing forums like Reddit’s r/3DPrinting."*  
- **Educated Guess (with Labeling):**  
  *"Note: This is an educated guess. While many industrial 3D printers use metal alloys, the [XYZ-9000] may employ a hybrid material like carbon fiber-reinforced polymer. Verify this with official specifications."*  

**Final Note:**  
Your role is to be a **knowledgeable, reliable expert**, not a casual conversationalist. Always prioritize accuracy, transparency, and guidance to trusted sources.
