Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to run on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. The user prefers macOS but is okay with Linux or Windows as alternatives. Their main goal is to avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing the workflow in a local remote desktop.

Okay, first, I need to understand what exactly the user is looking for. They want something containerized, so that means it should be packaged in a way that can run consistently across different environments without too much setup. Proxmox is their host, which is a Debian-based Linux distribution known for its virtualization and container capabilities.

The key here is persistence. So whatever remote desktop solution they choose needs to remember the state between sessions, especially for things like 3D printing slicer settings. That means each user should have their own configuration files or directories that don't get reset when the session ends or the container restarts.

They mentioned avoiding syncing configurations across machines by centralizing in a local remote desktop. So maybe they want everything stored locally instead of in the cloud, which might be a concern for data privacy or internet dependence.

Now, considering macOS preference but open to Linux or Windows: that's interesting because native macOS containers on Proxmox aren't straightforward since Proxmox is based on Debian. However, with containerization technologies like Docker and containerd, maybe they can run macOS in a container, though that might be challenging due to Apple's restrictions on running arbitrary code.

Alternatively, using Linux-based solutions could be more feasible, especially if they're already okay with that. Or perhaps setting up a Windows environment within Proxmox, as it supports many versions of Windows as guests.

Let me think about some possible options:

1. **Linux Containers (LCX)**: Since Proxmox is Debian-based, running Linux containers makes sense. Tools like `docker` or `containerd` can be used to manage these containers. For persistence, each container could mount a local directory where user-specific configurations are stored. This way, when the container restarts, it picks up where it left off.

2. **macOS in Containers**: While not natively supported on Proxmox, there might be ways to run macOS as a container using something like `osxemulator`. This could allow running macOS applications within Linux containers, providing some level of persistence across sessions.

3. **Windows Containers**: Proxmox can host Windows guests, especially with tools like `virt-manager` or direct ISO mounting. However, managing persistence in Windows containers might require more setup, especially for user-specific settings and application data.

I need to evaluate each option based on the requirements:

- **Persistence**: Each solution needs to store user configurations locally so that they persist across container restarts.
- **Centralized Workflow**: The user's workflows (like 3D printing slicer) should be managed within a local desktop environment, not relying on cloud services.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Even though macOS is preferred, having alternatives is good.

Let me break down each possible solution:

**1. Linux Containers (LCX):**
   - Proxmox supports Docker and containerd out of the box.
   - Using `docker-compose` can help manage multiple containers as part of a single workflow.
   - For persistence, each container can bind a local directory. For example, a 3D printing slicer container could have a volume `/var/lib/slicer-configs` that's persistent across reboots.
   - This setup would allow the user to access their configurations directly from within the container without needing to sync or share files elsewhere.

**2. macOS in Containers:**
   - Using `osxemulator` might be a way, but it's more of a Mac app running on Linux. It can run macOS applications like Sierra or High Sierra.
   - The challenge here is getting 3D printing slicers to work within this environment and ensuring that the configurations persist correctly when the container restarts.
   - The user experience would be more seamless if they can interact with macOS-like interfaces without needing a physical Mac.

**3. Windows Containers:**
   - Proxmox can host Windows guests, which means users could run applications like Windows-based 3D printing slicers.
   - Persistence in Windows containers is achievable by using shared directories or volumes that are mounted locally.
   - However, managing Windows environments can be more resource-intensive and might require additional setup for compatibility.

Considering the above, Linux Containers seem like a strong candidate because Proxmox supports them natively. They allow for easy configuration management and persistence without too much hassle. macOS in containers is possible but may have some limitations due to its architecture, while Windows would work but might not be as efficient or persistent.

Another consideration is whether these containers need access to local hardware features like USB 3D printers. If the slicer needs to control or interact with physical devices, the container must have the right permissions and drivers, which can sometimes be tricky in cross-platform setups.

In terms of managing workflows, having a central configuration directory within the Proxmox host's filesystem ensures that configurations aren't synced across machines but are accessed through the local remote desktop session. This way, each user has their own set of config files in a known location, and any changes made during a session are immediately available the next time they log in.

So, putting it all together, using Linux Containers with Docker or containerd on Proxmox seems like the best approach for the user's needs. It provides flexibility, persistence, and compatibility without too much complexity.

To address your requirements for a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox, particularly for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations, I recommend using **Linux Containers (LCX)** with Docker or containerd. This setup offers several benefits:

### Solution Overview:
- **Containerization**: Utilize Linux containers via tools like `docker` or `containerd`, which are natively supported on Proxmox.
- **Persistence**: Ensure user-specific configurations are stored in local directories that persist across container restarts by using volumes or mounts.

### Key Benefits:
1. **Native Support**: Proxmox supports Docker and containerd, making setup straightforward.
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: While optimized for Linux, solutions can be adapted to macOS or Windows with additional setup if needed.
3. **User Configurations**: Store user configurations in local directories (e.g., `/var/lib/slicer-configs`), ensuring data persistence without cloud reliance.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Install Docker/Containerd**: Use `apt install docker.io` for Docker, or `containerd` for a lightweight alternative.
2. **Set Up Volumes**: Create persistent volumes to store user configurations, ensuring they remain accessible after container restarts.
3. **Run Containers**: Use `docker-compose` or `containerd run` to launch containers with required dependencies and configurations.

### Considerations:
- **Hardware Interaction**: Ensure containers have necessary permissions for local hardware interactions (e.g., USB access).
- **User Experience**: Provide a seamless desktop environment, possibly using VNC or X2Go for remote access.

This approach effectively centralizes workflows in a local environment, avoiding cloud dependencies and ensuring persistence across sessions.
