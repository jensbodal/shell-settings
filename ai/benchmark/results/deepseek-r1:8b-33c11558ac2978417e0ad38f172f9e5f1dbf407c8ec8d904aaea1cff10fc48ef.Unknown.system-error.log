Okay, so I need to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to use on Proxmox. The main goal is to manage persistent workflows, like setting up 3D printing slicer configurations. The user prefers macOS but is open to Linux or Windows if necessary. They also want to avoid syncing configurations across machines by centralizing everything locally in a remote desktop setup.

First, I'll start by understanding what containerized environments are. Containers are lightweight virtualization technologies that allow you to package up an application along with its dependencies into a single image. This makes it easy to run the same environment on different machines without worrying about compatibility issues. Proxmox is a open-source virtualization software that supports containers, so that's a good starting point.

Now, the user wants something persistent. That means when the container stops or reboots, the data inside should still be there. I remember that with containers, especially in Proxmox, you can use volumes to mount directories on the host machine. So, by mapping a volume to the container, changes within the container are saved to the host's storage, making them persistent.

Next, they mentioned managing workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations. Slicers require specific software setups. The user prefers macOS but is okay with others. I should think about which environments would support these tools. For example, Cura is a popular slicer for 3D printing and runs on both Windows and Linux, but not natively on macOS unless using something like Parallels or Boot Camp.

So, if we're setting this up on Proxmox, maybe the best approach is to use a container that can run multiple operating systems. Docker has support for running different OSes as containers, but Proxmox might have its own container system. I should check what containerization tools are available in Proxmox.

Proxmox supports both Docker and their own container system called ProxMux. Using Docker might be more standard since it's widely used, so perhaps going with that is better for community support and third-party images.

Now, how to set this up: I'll need a base image that includes the necessary software. For a slicer, maybe start with Ubuntu or Windows Server as a base. Then, add volumes to mount the configuration files so they persist across container restarts. Also, ensure that the remote desktop environment can access these configurations without syncing them across machines.

The user wants a local remote desktop setup, so perhaps using VNC or Spice to connect to a Proxmox VM. That way, the VM acts as the remote desktop with persistent volumes attached.

I should also think about security and resource usage. Ensuring that the container doesn't use too many resources on Proxmox is important, especially if it's running on a lower-end server. Also, managing backups or snapshots in Proxmox to prevent data loss.

Let me outline possible steps:

1. Install Proxmox on the server.
2. Create a container image based on a suitable OS (Windows, Linux, macOS).
3. Use Docker/ProxMux to run this image as a container on Proxmox.
4. Map persistent volumes in Proxmox to store configuration files.
5. Set up a remote desktop environment using VNC or Spice within the container.
6. Install necessary software within the container for slicing.
7. Ensure configurations are saved to the persistent volume, not syncing across machines.

Wait, but running macOS in a container might be tricky because of Apple's restrictions on virtualization. I think only specific versions of macOS can run in virtual environments, and that might require special setup. Maybe it's better to use Linux or Windows for the container unless macOS is absolutely necessary.

So, if macOS is preferred, perhaps using a macOS VM on Proxmox as the remote desktop, then inside that VM, running containers. But I'm not sure how well that would work with containerization. Alternatively, use a Linux or Windows container within Proxmox and have the remote desktop access it.

Another thought: maybe using a remote desktop software like Remote Desktop Services (RDS) on Proxmox to host the remote sessions, and then run containers there with persistent volumes attached. That way, each user's session is isolated but can access the same configurations via the volume.

I think I need to research if Proxmox supports containerized environments within VMs or as standalone containers. Also, check if Docker can be used effectively in this setup without significant performance hits.

In summary, the plan is:

- Use Proxmox's containerization features (Docker/ProxMux) to run a persistent environment.
- Choose an appropriate base OS for the container (maybe Linux or Windows since macOS might have limitations).
- Map a volume in Proxmox to persist configuration files within the container.
- Set up the remote desktop (VNC/Spiice) to connect users to this containerized environment.

Potential challenges include ensuring smooth container performance, managing user sessions without conflicts, and handling persistence correctly across reboots. Also, verifying that all necessary software can be installed and configured within the container.

I should also look into existing Proxmox setups where users have managed similar persistent workflows with containers, possibly using specific Dockerfile configurations or volume mappings.

To set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing 3D printing slicer configurations with persistence, follow these steps:

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Install Proxmox VE:**
   - Ensure Proxmox Virtualization Environment (Proxmox VE) is installed on your server.

2. **Set Up Docker/ProxMux:**
   - Use either Docker or ProxMux to containerize applications. For simplicity, start with Docker.

3. **Prepare Base Image:**
   - Choose a base OS for the container:
     - Linux (e.g., Ubuntu) for broader compatibility.
     - Windows if macOS is not necessary.
   - Create a Dockerfile or ProxMux configuration that includes necessary software like Cura or other slicers.

4. **Create and Run Container:**
   - Use `docker build` or ProxMux to create the container image.
   - Run the container on Proxmox, ensuring it's placed in a persistent storage volume (e.g., via Docker Volumes or Proxmox storage).

5. **Map Persistent Volumes:**
   - In Proxmox, create and attach a volume to the container to store slicer configurations. This ensures data persistence across container restarts.

6. **Configure Remote Desktop Access:**
   - Use VNC or Spice to provide remote access to the containerized environment.
   - Ensure each session can access the persistent volume without overwriting changes.

7. **Install and Configure Slicer Software:**
   - Within the container, install required software like Cura, Primacy, or other slicers.
   - Configure these tools within the container's environment, saving settings to the persistent volume.

8. **Test and Validate:**
   - Ensure that configurations are preserved after container restarts.
   - Verify that remote access works smoothly and all necessary tools are functional.

9. **Optimize Performance and Security:**
   - Monitor resource usage to ensure the setup is efficient.
   - Apply security best practices, such as regular updates and secure volume permissions.

10. **Backups and Snapshots:**
    - Configure Proxmox backups or snapshots for the container and its volumes to prevent data loss.

### **Final Considerations**

- **OS Choice:** Use Linux or Windows for containers if macOS is challenging due to virtualization limitations.
- **Persistence Management:** Ensure all user-specific configurations are saved to persistent volumes, not synced across machines.
- **User Sessions:** Use session management tools within Proxmox to handle multiple users without conflicts.

By following these steps, you can create a robust, containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that centralizes workflows and maintains persistence efficiently.
