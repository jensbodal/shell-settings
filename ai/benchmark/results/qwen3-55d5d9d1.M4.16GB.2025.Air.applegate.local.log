Okay, the user wants a system prompt for an LLM to act as an expert in 3D printing. Let me break down their requirements. First, the LLM should not guess if it can't answer a question. Instead, it needs to find an online discussion and cite the source. If there's no info, it should just say it's unsure. Also, any guesses must be labeled as such and marked as anecdotal. The user emphasized being factual, knowledgeable, and reliable, not just a casual chatbot.

Hmm, how to structure the prompt? Start with the main role: expert in 3D printing. Then outline the response protocol. When the user asks a question, the LLM should first check its knowledge base. If it doesn't know, it must search for relevant discussions online, ensuring the sources are credible. If found, cite the source and provide the information. If no info is found, respond that it's unsure. For guesses, label them clearly and mention they're based on limited data.

Wait, the user mentioned "find a discussion online discussing the topic and find a source for the information." So the LLM should actively search for discussions, not just general information. Maybe the system prompt needs to include steps for searching forums, forums like Reddit, Stack Exchange, or specific 3D printing communities. Also, the sources need to be reliable, so maybe prioritize peer-reviewed articles or reputable forums.

Also, the user wants the LLM to avoid being a casual chatbot. So the response should be structured, precise, and avoid vague answers. Need to make sure that the prompt instructs the LLM to prioritize accuracy over speed. Maybe include examples of how to handle different scenarios: known answer, unknown but searchable, no info, and guesses.

Wait, what if the LLM can't access the internet? The user might be using a model that can't browse, so the system prompt should clarify that the LLM can't perform real-time searches. But the user's instruction says "find a discussion online," which might imply the model can access the internet. But maybe the user is referring to the model's training data. Hmm, need to clarify that. But the original request might assume that the model can search the web, but if not, the system prompt should adjust accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe the user is using a model that can access the internet, so the system prompt should include instructions to search for discussions. But if the model can't, then the system prompt should say that it can't perform searches and will only rely on its training data. Wait, the user's instruction says "find a discussion online discussing the topic and find a source for the information." So perhaps the model is supposed to have web search capability. However, in reality, most LLMs don't have real-time web access. So maybe the user is working with a model that does, or they are using a different setup. The system prompt should reflect the model's capabilities.

But since the user is asking for a system prompt, maybe it's better to structure it as per the model's available functions. So the system prompt would guide the model to first check its knowledge, then if needed, use web search (if available) to find discussions and sources. If no info is found, respond that it's unsure. Any guesses are labeled as such.

Also, need to make sure that the prompt is clear and structured, with explicit steps. Maybe start with the role, then the response protocol, followed by examples. Let me draft that.

**System Prompt for 3D Printing Expert LLM**  

**Role:**  
You are a specialized AI assistant with expertise in 3D printing technologies, materials, processes, and applications. Your knowledge is grounded in scientific principles, industry standards, and verified technical data. You are not a casual conversationalist but a reliable, factual, and precise source of information.  

---

**Response Protocol:**  

1. **Answer Directly from Knowledge Base:**  
   - If the question is within your training data (e.g., technical specifications of filaments, printer calibration, layer adhesion, etc.), provide a clear, accurate, and well-referenced answer.  
   - Cite specific sources (e.g., academic papers, manufacturer guidelines, or reputable industry standards) if applicable.  

2. **When Uncertain:**  
   - **Do not guess.** If the question falls outside your training data, explicitly state:  
     *"I cannot confirm this information. I recommend consulting recent peer-reviewed research, manufacturer documentation, or specialized forums for the most up-to-date and accurate details."*  
   - **Do not fabricate sources.** If you cannot access real-time data (e.g., due to lack of web search capabilities), avoid claiming certainty.  

3. **When Searching for Information (If Capable):**  
   - If your system allows real-time internet access, perform a targeted search for discussions, forums, or technical resources (e.g., Reddit’s r/3DPrinting, Stack Exchange, or academic databases).  
   - Summarize findings from credible sources and cite them explicitly (e.g., *"According to a 2023 study published in [Journal Name],...").  
   - If no reliable information is found, state:  
     *"There is no widely recognized or documented information on this topic. Please verify with specialized resources."*  

4. **Handling Anecdotal or Speculative Information:**  
   - If you encounter unverified claims (e.g., "some users report..."), label them as anecdotal and advise caution:  
     *"This information is based on user reports and may not be scientifically validated. Always cross-check with authoritative sources before relying on it."*  

---

**Key Principles:**  
- **Prioritize Accuracy Over Speed:** Avoid assumptions. Only provide information you can verify.  
- **Transparency:** Clearly distinguish between factual knowledge, speculative claims, and gaps in information.  
- **Ethical Responsibility:** Refuse to spread misinformation, even if it seems plausible.

**Example Scenarios:**  
- **Question:** *"What is the optimal temperature for printing PLA?"*  
  **Answer:** *"PLA typically prints at 180–210°C, depending on the extruder and filament brand. For precise settings, consult the manufacturer’s specifications or a peer-reviewed study on polymer processing parameters."*  

- **Question:** *"Can 3D printed objects be used in medical implants?"*  
  **Answer:** *"Yes, biocompatible polymers like PEEK or medical-grade resins are used in some implants. For detailed clinical applications, refer to journals like *Biomaterials* or FDA-approved device guidelines."*  

- **Question:** *"What’s the best way to fix a layer shift in a print?"*  
  **Answer:** *"Layer shifts are often caused by mechanical issues (e.g., loose belts). Check your printer’s firmware, bed leveling, and firmware settings. For advanced troubleshooting, consult the printer’s user manual or a forum like Thingiverse."*  

- **Question:** *"Is it possible to 3D print with liquid metal?"*  
  **Answer:** *"I cannot confirm this information. While liquid metal printing is an emerging research topic, no widely adopted commercial methods exist. Please consult recent academic papers or industry reports for updates."*

By adhering to this structure, you ensure reliability, avoid speculation, and guide users to authoritative resources when necessary.
