⠙ ⠙ ⠸ ⠸ ⠴ ⠦ To achieve a centralized and consistent remote desktop environment for managing workflows such as 3D printing slicer configuration on Proxmox, you can use several containerized solutions. Here’s a breakdown of options based on your preference for macOS-like environments or other operating systems:

### Linux-Based Options

1. **VNC with Docker/Kubernetes:**
   - **X11-Forwarding:** Use VNC servers like `TigerVNC` or `TightVNC` inside a container to provide remote desktop access.
   - **Docker Setup:** Deploy applications in containers and use tools like `xrdp` for Linux environments with an RDP client that supports X11 forwarding. 
   - **Kubernetes:** You can orchestrate multiple VNC sessions using Kubernetes, which helps manage resources efficiently.

2. **NoMachine:**
   - Offers a high-performance desktop-sharing application. It's known for its smooth performance and is available in containerized form.
   - Provides an experience similar to macOS with minimal setup complexity.

3. **X2Go:**
   - A remote desktop system that provides secure access to Linux desktops or applications running on servers.
   - Works well with Debian-based systems, which you can run inside containers.

4. **Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS):**
   - Run Docker Desktop in a containerized setup to emulate macOS environments using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2 capabilities if necessary.
   - Use this setup to manage different workflows consistently across sessions without syncing files.

### macOS-like Experience

1. **VirtualBox with macOS Image:**
   - Although not natively supported on Proxmox, you can set up VirtualBox in a Docker container using solutions like `docker4mac` or `virtualbox-headless`.
   - Run macOS images for specific applications and access via RDP/VNC.

2. **Parallels Desktop for Mac (via Parallels Toolbox):**
   - Provides a way to run macOS environments on non-Mac hardware, though it requires a license.
   - Can be used in conjunction with Docker to manage configurations centrally.

### Windows-Based Options

1. **Windows Containers:**
   - Use Windows Server containers or Hyper-V containers to host applications like 3D printing slicers directly within the container environment.
   - Access via RDP, using tools like `rdpwrap` for a smoother experience.

2. **Raspberry Pi Desktop (via WSL):**
   - Although unconventional, you can run a lightweight Linux desktop inside WSL and access it remotely from Windows or macOS clients.
   
3. **Remote Desktop Services:**
   - Set up RDS on Proxmox using Windows Server VMs, allowing centralized management of workflows through standard RDP clients.

### General Recommendations

- **Storage Management:** Use shared storage solutions (e.g., NFS, iSCSI) to persist configurations and data across sessions.
- **Security:** Ensure secure access with VPNs or SSH tunnels to protect your remote desktop environment.
- **Performance Tuning:** Allocate adequate resources (CPU, RAM) in Proxmox for containers/VMs running these environments to ensure smooth operation.

Each option has its pros and cons depending on the specific applications you plan to run. For a macOS-like experience without actual macOS hardware, using NoMachine or Docker Desktop with Linux-based solutions often provides a satisfactory balance of ease of use and performance.
