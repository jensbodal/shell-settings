*   **Standardized Integration:** MCP is an open protocol designed to establish a standardized way for applications to share contextual information with language models and expose tools to AI systems, facilitating the creation of composable AI workflows.
*   **JSON-RPC Core:** The protocol utilizes JSON-RPC 2.0 messages for communication between Hosts (LLM applications), Clients (connectors within the host), and Servers (providing context and capabilities).
*   **Security Focus:** MCP emphasizes user consent, data privacy, and tool safety, requiring implementors to build robust authorization flows, provide clear documentation, and implement appropriate access controls to mitigate potential risks associated with arbitrary data access and code execution.
