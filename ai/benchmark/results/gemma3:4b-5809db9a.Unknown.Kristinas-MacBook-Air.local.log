*   **MCP is a standardized protocol** for seamlessly connecting LLM applications with external data sources and tools, utilizing JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.
*   **It defines roles for Hosts, Clients, and Servers** – LLM applications, connectors, and data/capability providers – to facilitate communication and data exchange.
*   **Security is a core focus**, with the specification emphasizing user consent, data privacy, tool safety, and limiting server visibility into prompts, requiring implementors to build robust consent flows and security controls.
