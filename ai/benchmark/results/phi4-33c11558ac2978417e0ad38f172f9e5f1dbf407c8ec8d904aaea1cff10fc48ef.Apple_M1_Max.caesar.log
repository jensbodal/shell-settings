⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠸ To achieve a centralized, persistent workflow for tasks like 3D printer slicing using Proxmox and containerization, you'll want a setup that combines a reliable desktop environment with robust management tools. Here’s a suggested approach:

### Container Choice

1. **Linux-Based Option:**
   - **Ubuntu Desktop in LXC/LXD**: Ubuntu is user-friendly, well-supported, and has excellent compatibility for various applications, including 3D printing slicers like Cura or PrusaSlicer.
     - **Advantages**: Lightweight compared to VMs, supports GUI apps through X11 forwarding or VNC. It can be configured to start automatically on system boot, ensuring persistence.

2. **macOS Alternative (via Windows):**
   - If macOS is a strong preference and you're open to using it indirectly via Windows, consider:
     - **Parallels Desktop for Mac on a Windows VM**: Parallels supports running macOS seamlessly in a virtual machine environment.
       - **Advantages**: Provides a native macOS experience with good 3D slicer support.

### Remote Desktop Access

1. **VNC Server:**
   - Set up a VNC server inside the container to provide remote access. TightVNC or TigerVNC are popular choices and integrate well with Proxmox.
   - Configure your client device to connect to this VNC server for accessing the desktop environment.

2. **X11 Forwarding (for Linux Containers):**
   - Use SSH with X11 forwarding if you’re connecting from a Unix-like system. This is lightweight but may require additional setup on both host and container sides.
   - Ensure `xauth` and necessary packages are installed in your container to facilitate this.

3. **RDP for Windows-based VMs:**
   - If using Parallels or another macOS solution within Windows, consider setting up an RDP server (like FreeRDP) on the host machine to access it remotely.

### Configuration Persistence

- Store user configurations and application data in persistent storage volumes mapped to your Proxmox container. This ensures that any changes made within the environment persist across reboots or restarts.
  
- Use Docker volumes or LXD profiles for managing persistent storage if you prefer using Docker containers instead of traditional Linux Containers.

### Setup Example

#### For Ubuntu Desktop in LXC:

1. **Create a Container:**
   - Use Proxmox to create an LXC container running Ubuntu with desktop capabilities (`ubuntu-desktop` package).

2. **Install VNC Server:**
   ```bash
   apt update && apt install tightvncserver
   vncserver :1
   ```
   Configure it to start at boot by adding the necessary service files.

3. **Persistent Storage:**
   - Map a storage volume for user home directories to ensure persistence of configurations and data.

4. **Access Setup:**
   - Connect via VNC client using `localhost:<VNC_PORT>` from your local machine or configure port forwarding if accessing externally.

This setup will allow you to manage persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration efficiently, regardless of the host system's OS, by centralizing these tasks within a containerized environment.
