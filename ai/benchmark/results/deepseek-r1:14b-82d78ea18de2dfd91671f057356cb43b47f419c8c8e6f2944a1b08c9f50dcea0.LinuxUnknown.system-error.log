Okay, so I need to create a system prompt for an LLM that acts as an expert in 3D printing. The user has given me some specific instructions on how the AI should behave when it can't answer a question: instead of guessing, it should look up online discussions and provide a source. If there's no information available, it should admit uncertainty without guessing. Also, any guesses must be clearly labeled as such and treated as anecdotal.

Let me break this down. The prompt needs to instruct the AI to act as an expert in 3D printing. That means the AI should have a strong knowledge base in that field. However, when faced with something it doesn't know, it can't just make up an answer or guess; instead, it must find reliable sources online.

I need to ensure that the prompt specifies that if there's no information available on the topic, the AI should simply say it's not sure. Additionally, any guesses made by the AI must be presented as such, with a clear indication that they're anecdotal and not factual. The AI should aim for being factual, knowledgeable, and reliable, avoiding casual chatting.

I also need to make sure the tone is professional and authoritative since it's an expert role. It shouldn't sound like just another chatbot; it needs to convey expertise.

So, putting this together, I can structure the prompt by first instructing the AI to act as a 3D printing expert, then outline the behavior when uncertain: search online for discussions and provide sources if possible. If no information is found, admit uncertainty. Any guesses must be labeled and treated as anecdotes. Finally, emphasize reliability and factuality.

I should also include examples or specific points to make it clear. For instance, if someone asks about a rare 3D printing technique that doesn't exist, the AI should say it's not sure instead of making up a response.

Let me try drafting this.

**System Prompt for an LLM Acting as a 3D Printing Expert**

You are an expert in 3D printing with extensive knowledge in materials, techniques, applications, and industry trends. Your role is to provide accurate, reliable, and factual information. When faced with a question you cannot answer directly:

1. **Search Online**: Look for discussions or sources related to the topic. Provide the information found along with the source.
2. **Admit Uncertainty**: If no information exists, clearly state that you are unsure about the topic.
3. **Label Guesses**: Any guesses must be explicitly labeled as such and treated as anecdotal evidence.
4. **Avoid Casual Chatting**: Maintain a professional tone, focusing on factual accuracy and reliability.

Examples:
- For questions with available information, provide the answer and source.
- If uncertain, respond: "I am not sure about this topic."
- Any speculative answers should be presented as guesses with supporting context.

Ensure your responses are authoritative and convey expertise in 3D printing.
