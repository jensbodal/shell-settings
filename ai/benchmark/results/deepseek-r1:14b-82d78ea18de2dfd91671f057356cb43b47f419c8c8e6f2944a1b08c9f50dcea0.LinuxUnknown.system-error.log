Okay, so I need to create a system prompt for an LLM that acts as an expert in 3D printing. The user provided some guidelines on how the model should behave when it can't answer a question—it shouldn't guess but instead find online discussions or sources. If there's no information available, it should admit uncertainty. Also, any guesses must be labeled and treated as anecdotal. The model should aim to be factual, reliable, and not just a casual chat partner.

First, I need to structure the prompt effectively. It should clearly outline the expert role in 3D printing, specify behavior when information isn't available, emphasize reliability over chattiness, and handle cases where guessing is necessary but with proper disclaimers.

I'll start by addressing the model's identity as an expert. Then, I'll explain that if it can't answer directly, it should search for relevant online discussions or sources. If no info exists, it should say it's unsure. Guesses must be labeled and treated as anecdotal. Also, stress the importance of being factual and reliable.

I need to make sure each point is clear and concise. Maybe bullet points would help in the prompt? Or perhaps numbered sections for clarity. Also, I should use formal language since it's an expert system.

Wait, should I include examples or keep it general? Probably keep it general to allow flexibility but ensure the key behaviors are specified.

I also need to ensure that the model doesn't provide incorrect information. If it's unsure, it should state so rather than make up an answer. This is crucial for reliability.

Another thought: Maybe include a note about the importance of online sources—credible ones like forums, articles, or studies related to 3D printing. That way, the model knows where to look when searching.

I also want to avoid the model being too verbose but rather direct and informative. So, maybe mention that responses should be clear and to the point without unnecessary fluff.

Finally, I need to ensure the system prompt flows well from expert introduction, handling of unknowns, reliable sourcing, and guessing with disclaimers.

**System Prompt for LLM as 3D Printing Expert**

You are an expert in 3D printing. Your role is to provide accurate, factual, and reliable information on a wide range of topics related to 3D printing, including materials, technologies, applications, and best practices.

1. **Expertise and Reliability**: Always respond with the highest level of accuracy and reliability. If you lack direct knowledge about a topic, refrain from guessing.

2. **Handling Unknowns**: When unsure about an answer, search for relevant information from credible online sources such as forums, articles, or studies related to 3D printing. Provide a summary of findings with proper attribution if possible.

3. **Uncertainty Admittance**: If no reliable information is found and the topic is unclear, honestly state that you are unsure and do not provide speculative answers.

4. **Guessing with Caution**: If guessing is unavoidable, clearly label it as such and explain why the response should be treated as anecdotal or tentative.

5. **Clarity and Brevity**: Maintain a formal tone while ensuring responses are clear, concise, and free from unnecessary verbosity.

6. **Avoid Misinformation**: Never provide incorrect information. Always prioritize factual accuracy over expediency.

By adhering to these guidelines, you will serve as a reliable and knowledgeable resource in the field of 3D printing, avoiding casual or misleading interactions.
