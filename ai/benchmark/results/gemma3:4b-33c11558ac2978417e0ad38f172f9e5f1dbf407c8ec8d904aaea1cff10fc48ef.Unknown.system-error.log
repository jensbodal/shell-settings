Okay, let's break down the best containerized remote desktop environments for Proxmox, specifically tailored to your needs of managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations. You want a centralized, local remote desktop solution.

Here's a ranked breakdown of options, considering macOS preference, Linux/Windows compatibility, and ease of use within a Proxmox container environment:

**Top Tier – Highly Recommended**

1. **Xrdp + macOS Container (Best Overall)**

   * **Why it's great:** This is arguably the *best* solution if you're committed to macOS. Xrdp is a free and open-source RDP server, and running it within a macOS container provides a very familiar and powerful experience.  It’s specifically designed for a persistent workflow.
   * **Containerization:** You’ll use Docker to create a macOS container with Xrdp installed. You can use a pre-built macOS container image from Docker Hub or build your own.
   * **3D Printing Workflow:** macOS’s software ecosystem is excellent for 3D printing, with robust slicers like Cura, Simplify3D, and PrusaSlicer.
   * **Persistence:** Once set up, your slicer configurations and settings persist within the container.  Updates to the macOS container don't affect your existing workflow.
   * **Proxmox Integration:** Docker is seamlessly integrated with Proxmox.
   * **Cost:** Free (open-source).
   * **Downsides:** Requires macOS.  Setting up a Docker container takes some initial effort.

2. **VNC + Linux Container (Solid Alternative - Especially for Linux Users)**

   * **Why it's good:** VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a mature and widely supported remote access protocol. Running it within a Linux container is very straightforward.
   * **Containerization:** Docker can create a Linux container (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) and install a VNC server (TightVNC, RealVNC).
   * **3D Printing Workflow:**  Linux has excellent 3D printing support as well, with tools like PrusaSlicer, OctoPrint (which can be embedded in a container), and Cura (available for Linux).
   * **Persistence:**  Configure your 3D printing software within the container.
   * **Proxmox Integration:** Excellent – Docker integration is very mature.
   * **Cost:** Free (open-source).
   * **Downsides:**  VNC can be less secure than RDP and sometimes a bit slower.

**Second Tier – Good Options with Considerations**

3. **TeamViewer (Docker Container)**

   * **Why it's good:**  TeamViewer is a very popular and user-friendly remote access solution.  It's easy to set up.
   * **Containerization:** Docker can run a TeamViewer session inside a container.
   * **3D Printing Workflow:** Works with any OS.
   * **Persistence:** Configuration is within the container.
   * **Proxmox Integration:** Decent.
   * **Cost:**  Free for personal use (limited features). Paid plans available for business use.
   * **Downsides:**  Reliance on a third-party service.  Some users are wary of the security implications.



4. **Remmina (Linux Container)**

   * **Why it's good:** Remmina is a versatile RDP client for Linux. Running it within a container makes it a self-contained remote access solution.
   * **Containerization:** Docker creates a Linux container with Remmina and an RDP server (like xrdp or Microsoft RDP).
   * **3D Printing Workflow:**  Works with any OS.
   * **Persistence:** Configuration is within the container.
   * **Proxmox Integration:** Good.

**Key Considerations for Your Workflow**

* **Slicer Software:**  Ensure your chosen slicer software is compatible with the operating system of the container. macOS has a strong advantage here.
* **Proxmox Networking:**  Properly configure your Proxmox host's networking to allow access to the container’s assigned IP address.
* **Firewall Rules:** Configure firewall rules on your Proxmox host to allow traffic to the container’s port (typically 3389 for RDP or 5900 for VNC).
* **Security:**  Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication if available, and keep your container images up-to-date to mitigate security risks.

**Recommendation Summary**

* **Best Overall (if you want macOS):** Xrdp + macOS Container.
* **Best for Linux Users:** VNC + Linux Container.
* **Easiest to Use:** TeamViewer (but be mindful of third-party reliance).

To help me narrow down the best recommendation *for you*, could you tell me:

*   **What is your primary operating system?** (macOS, Linux, Windows)
*   **Which 3D printing slicer software do you plan to use?** (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer, Simplify3D, OctoPrint)
*   **What's your comfort level with Docker and containerization?** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
