⠙ Okay, let's break down the best containerized remote desktop environments for your Proxmox setup, focusing on persistent workflows like 3D printing and your goal of centralized configuration. You've nailed the key requirements: containerization, persistence, and a good remote desktop experience.

Here's a prioritized breakdown, with macOS, Linux, and Windows options:

**1.  VNC with Docker (Best Overall - Highly Recommended)**

* **Why it's Great:** This is arguably the *most* practical and flexible solution for your needs.  It's mature, relatively lightweight, and highly configurable.
* **Containerization:** You'll run a VNC server inside a Docker container.
* **Remote Desktop:** VNC itself provides a robust remote desktop experience.
* **Persistence:**  The VNC server container can be configured to store its configuration files within the container's persistent storage. This eliminates syncing issues.
* **OS Support:**  You can run VNC servers on macOS, Linux, or Windows. You’d likely want a Linux base image for Proxmox.
* **Ease of Setup:** Relatively straightforward using Docker Compose.
* **Cost:** Free (VNC software is open-source)
* **Example Docker Compose File (Basic):**

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  vnc:
    image: jwstoff/vnc-server
    container_name: vnc_server
    ports:
      - "5900:5900"  # Standard VNC port
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - vnc_data:/home/vnc/.vnc  # Persistent storage for VNC configuration

volumes:
  vnc_data:
```

* **Workflow Integration:**  You'd integrate your slicer (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura) *inside* the container.  This ensures consistent configuration across all your Proxmox machines.



**2.  X2Go (Excellent for Linux/Windows, Good Performance)**

* **Why it's Great:** X2Go is specifically designed for remote access and is known for its performance, particularly over slower networks.
* **Containerization:** You can run X2Go inside a Docker container.
* **Remote Desktop:** X2Go's remote desktop protocol is highly optimized.
* **Persistence:**  Like VNC, you can configure persistent storage for the X2Go server's data.
* **OS Support:** Best on Linux, but you *can* run it on Windows (with some extra configuration).
* **Ease of Setup:**  Requires some initial setup but has good documentation.
* **Cost:** Free (Open source)
* **Workflow Integration:**  Similar to VNC, you'd install your slicer *inside* the container.

**3.  TigerVNC + Docker (Good Alternative to VNC)**

* **Why it’s Good:** TigerVNC is a fork of VNC, often considered more modern and offers some performance improvements.
* **Containerization:**  Runs inside a Docker container.
* **Remote Desktop:** Provides a solid remote desktop experience.
* **Persistence:** Similar setup to VNC for persistent storage.
* **OS Support:** macOS, Linux, Windows.

**4.  TightVNC + Docker (Lightweight, but Less Feature-Rich)**

* **Why it’s Okay:** Very lightweight, easy to set up, but the remote desktop experience isn’t as polished as VNC.
* **Containerization:** Runs inside a Docker container.
* **Remote Desktop:** Basic VNC-like functionality.
* **Persistence:** Use persistent volumes.


**5.  Remmina (with VNC/TigerVNC - Not Containerized, but a good option)**

* **Why it’s Worth Considering:** Remmina is a fantastic *client* for VNC, TigerVNC, and other remote desktop protocols.  You'd run your VNC/TigerVNC server *outside* a container on Proxmox, and then use Remmina on your host machine to connect.
* **Workflow Integration:**  Again, you’d install the slicer *inside* the container.

**Recommendations & Prioritization**

1. **VNC with Docker (Most Recommended):**  This balances ease of use, flexibility, and performance. It's a solid foundation for your 3D printing workflows.

2. **X2Go with Docker:**  If you are concerned about network latency and need maximum performance, X2Go is a strong contender.

3. **Remmina + VNC/TigerVNC:** If you're comfortable with a slightly less polished remote desktop experience, Remmina can be a good option.

**Key Considerations for Persistent Workflows:**

* **Persistent Volumes:**  *Crucially*, you *must* use Docker persistent volumes to store the configuration files for your slicer and any other software running inside the container.  Without this, your settings will be lost when the container is restarted.
* **Base Image:**  Start with a lightweight Linux base image (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu) for the Docker container.
* **Networking:**  Configure networking correctly so your Proxmox machines can access the container’s network.



To help me refine my recommendations even further, could you tell me:

*   **What is your primary OS for the Proxmox host?** (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, Windows)
*   **What 3D printing software are you primarily using?** (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura, Simplify3D)
*   **What's your network setup like?** (e.g., local network, VPN, internet connection – this impacts performance)
