⠙ ⠙ Given your requirements and preferences, you might find LXD (Linux Containers) on Proxmox suitable for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration due to its ability to provide Linux-like environments while also being compatible with Windows drivers when needed. However, macOS is not natively supported by Proxmox's containers as it typically runs inside a virtual machine (VM) on the platform; thus, you would need an additional layer if your workflow demands macOS functionality directly within LXD/Proxmox environment without using VMs for better performance.

Here are two viable options considering both Linux and Windows compatibility:

1. **Using Virtual Machines with Desktop Environments inside** (macOS not natively supported by Proxmox, but possible via virtualization):
   - Choose a reliable hypervisor like XenServer or KVM that is compatible with your 3D printer hardware and has good performance characteristics for high-res resource usage. Both of these are well suinated in enterprise environments and offer isolation between multiple workloads on the same physical server, which can help you run macOS (via Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion) virtually inside a virtual machine running under Proxmox's hypervisor for your workflow.
   - Install an operating system like Ubuntu Server as it is compatible with LXD and has good 3D printer driver support, then set up the macOS in Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion within this environment to manage slicer configurations persistently. You can connect from Proxmox using SSH for command-line management while inside your desktop session if needed.
   - Use LXC containers as they offer a lightweight alternative that may perform better due to less overhead but remember, only Linux guests are supported within an LXD container directly without emulation layers or hypervisors like XenServer/KVM underneath. 

2. **Using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Proxmox**:
   - Install Ubuntu Server on your local machine and set it up as a centralized server where all the workflows are managed using WSL to run tools compatible with macOS environments like Meshwar, which supports 3D printing slicing. This way you can interact directly from Windows or Linux hosts without needing Mac hardware emulation/virtualization layers above Proxmox's KVM layer (for a more native experience).
   - You would then access your centralized workflow by using SSH to execute commands on the Ubuntu server, avoiding synchronizing configurations between machines. It is compatible with Windows and macOS but doesn't natively run within containers directly without emulation layers or hypervisors underneath since WSL uses a Linux kernel for its execution environment; however, if your slicer software can execute inside of Docker (which offers better integration into LXD/Proxmox), it could be an alternative.
   - Keep in mind that while this option avoids using Mac-specific hardware emulation and virtualization layers on Proxmox for a smoother experience, you will still require the WSL to run your Linux workloads natively from Windows hosts or use Docker if compatibility with macOS is desired outside of native systems.

In both options, it's crucial that whatever solution you choose supports all necessary hardware drivers and dependencies required by your 3D printer firmware—ensuring seamless slicer configuration across different operating systems without the need for frequent synchronization between machines or VM/container setups would be challenging. Always verify compatibility with specific versions of software tools, as this can change over time due to updates in both desktop environments and printing technology itself.

Finally, remember that managing persistent configurations effectively often involves additional considerations such as data backups, access controls (both at the container/VM level and through your network), version control systems for changes made during slicer configuration tasks, etc., which are beyond just selecting a suitable remote desktop environment or virtualization solution.
