⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠸ ⠴  For your specific use case, creating a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that supports macOS, Linux, and Windows for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration could be achieved using a combination of a Remote Desktop Solution (RDS) and Docker containers. Here's a suggested setup:

1. Choose a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server software that supports containerization, such as RDPWS (Remote Desktop Services for Windows Containers) or Remina (a lightweight open-source RDP server for Linux). Both options are compatible with Proxmox and Docker.

2. Create a dedicated Proxmox VM (Virtual Machine) for your centralized remote desktop environment. Install the operating system of your choice, either macOS, Linux or Windows, on this VM.

3. Configure the RDP server software on the selected OS, ensuring it's optimized for your specific use case, such as performance and security settings for 3D printing slicer configuration workflows.

4. Create a Dockerfile to build your application containers (e.g., the 3D printer slicer software) with persistent storage that can be accessed from within the RDP session. This will help centralize your workflow and avoid syncing configurations between machines.

5. Build and run the Docker containers for each required application on your centralized remote desktop environment, mapping necessary volumes to the host file system (i.e., the Proxmox VM) where they can be accessed by users within their RDP sessions.

6. Install any additional tools or utilities needed for managing 3D printing workflows and optimize your container environment as required.

7. Set up user access to the remote desktop environment, either through Active Directory for Windows-based solutions or LDAP/SSH connections for Linux-based solutions, depending on the RDP server software you choose.

By following this approach, you can create a centralized containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that supports macOS, Linux, and Windows, allowing you to manage persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration without the need for syncing configurations between machines.
