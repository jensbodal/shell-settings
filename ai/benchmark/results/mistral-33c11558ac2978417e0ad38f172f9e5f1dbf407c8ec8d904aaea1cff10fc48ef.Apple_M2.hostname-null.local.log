⠙ ⠙ ⠸ ⠼ ⠼  To achieve your goal of creating a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that supports various operating systems (macOS, Linux, and Windows) for persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, I recommend using Portainer for managing your containers and LXC for containerization. Here's a step-by-step guide to set this up:

1. Install Proxmox and ensure it's up-to-date.

2. Install Docker and LXC on Proxmox VMs or Containers (LXC is included in Proxmox by default). You can follow the official documentation for this: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_VE:_Docker

3. Install Portainer on your Proxmox host to manage your containers easily: https://docs.portainer.io/learn/deploy-portainer/deploy-using-docker-compose/

4. Choose an appropriate Remote Desktop Solution (RDS) for each OS you want to support:
   - macOS: CoRD or Remote Desktop Client can be used as an RDP client on macOS, and the MacStacion app can be deployed in a container to create a macOS server.
   - Linux: Xrdp is a popular choice for creating an RDP server on Linux containers.
   - Windows: You can use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) natively with your Windows container, or use AnyDesk or TeamViewer if you prefer them.

5. Create Dockerfiles for each of the above RDS and 3D slicer applications that you want to run. The Dockerfile should install the application and set it up as a service that starts automatically when the container boots.

6. Deploy these containers using Portainer, ensuring they share necessary volumes so that configurations are persistent across sessions.

7. Connect to your Proxmox host from another machine using RDP (for Windows), SSH (for Linux), or VNC/RDP (for macOS). Then, access the desired containerized applications within those sessions without worrying about syncing configurations between machines.

By following these steps, you'll have a centralized workflow that avoids configuration syncing between machines, allowing you to manage persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration efficiently.
