 To create a containerized remote desktop environment for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration on Proxmox, you can make use of Docker containers and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers for various operating systems (macOS, Linux, or Windows). Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set this up:

1. Install Docker on your Proxmox server if it isn't already installed:

   ```
   apt-get update && apt-get install docker.io -y
   systemctl enable docker --now
   ```

2. Install Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications:

   ```
   curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

3. Create a new directory for the containerized RDP server and navigate to it:

   ```
   mkdir rdp-server && cd rdp-server
   ```

4. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content (adjust according to your needs):

   ```
   version: "3"

   services:
     rdp-server:
       image: timholy/rdp:latest
       container_name: rdp-server
       environment:
         - RDP_USER=yourusername
         - RDP_PASS=yourpassword
         - RDPWHICH=xfreerdp
       ports:
         - "3389:3389"
   ```

5. Create a `start.sh` script to start the container and map the shared folders:

   ```
   #!/bin/bash

   # Map the desired folders (adjust path as needed)
   SHARED_FOLDER="/path/to/shared/folder"
   export SHARED_FOLDER

   docker-compose up -d

   # Wait for the container to be created
   sleep 5

   # Get the container ID
   CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps | grep rdp-server | awk '{print $1}')

   # Execute xfreerdp on the host, connecting to the RDP server in the container
   xfreerdp /v:$SHARED_FOLDER@$CONTAINER_ID -g 1920x1080 -u yourusername -p yourpassword localhost:3389
   ```

6. Make sure to replace `/path/to/shared/folder` with the path of the shared folder you want to access on the remote desktop and adjust the user, password, and port as needed.

7. Set the execution permissions for the script:

   ```
   chmod +x start.sh
   ```

8. Run the script to start the container and connect via RDP:

   ```
   ./start.sh
   ```

9. Now you can set up your preferred 3D printing slicer software on this remote desktop environment, which will help you avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing the workflow in a local remote desktop.total duration:       8.4106273s
