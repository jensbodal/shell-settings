 To achieve your goal of creating a containerized remote desktop environment in Proxmox that supports MacOS, Linux, and Windows for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, I would recommend using Portainer to manage containers, and then choose a suitable Remote Desktop Server (RDS) solution. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install Docker on Proxmox VE:
   Follow the official Proxmox VE documentation to install Docker: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_VE:_Install_Docker

2. Install Portainer:
   Portainer is a web-based UI for managing containers on your Docker host, and it can help you easily manage your RDS container.

   You can use the following command to deploy Portainer:

   ```
   docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v portainer_data:/data -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock portainer/portainer
   ```

3. Access Portainer UI:
   Open your browser and navigate to `https://<your_proxmox_host>:9000`. Login using the default credentials (admin/admin). You can change this password later in the settings.

4. Choose a suitable Remote Desktop Server:

    A. macOS (using Parallels RDS) - Unfortunately, Parallels RDS is not available for Proxmox VE as of now. You can use another solution like Microsoft's Remote Desktop Services (RDS), which requires a Windows Server installation.

    B. Linux (using X11VNC or TightVNC) - For Linux, you can use containerized solutions like X11VNC (for GUI apps) or TightVNC (for remote desktop functionality). You can find the Docker images on Docker Hub and configure them using Portainer.

    C. Windows (using Microsoft's Remote Desktop Services - RDS) - To run a containerized RDS solution for Windows, you can use WineRDP or FreeRDP. Similar to Linux solutions, you can find the Docker images on Docker Hub and configure them using Portainer.

5. Set up persistent storage for your containers:
   You can set up a local volume in Portainer that all your RDS containers will share for storing configuration files, such as 3D printing slicer settings.

6. Configure RDP clients to connect to the Remote Desktop Server container:
   Depending on the RDS solution you choose (X11VNC, TightVNC, WineRDP, FreeRDP), you will need to configure your client software accordingly. For example, for X11VNC, use an SSH tunnel and vncviewer in your Linux or MacOS machine.

By following this guide, you should be able to create a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox VE that suits your requirements. Keep in mind that not all RDS solutions are compatible with Proxmox VE, so you may need to adapt the setup depending on which solution you choose.
