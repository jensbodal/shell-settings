Okay, so I need to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to run on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. The user prefers macOS but is open to Linux or Windows. The main goal is to avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing everything in a local remote desktop.

First, I should consider what exactly a containerized remote desktop means here. Containers are lightweight and portable, so using containers on Proxmox makes sense for consistency across different hosts. Since Proxmox uses LXC/LXD as the container hypervisor, maybe I can leverage that.

The user wants to manage persistent workflows, especially 3D printing slicer configuration. That suggests they need an environment where their settings and data don't get lost between sessions. So, I should think about solutions that allow for persistence within the container.

Remote desktop environments mean something graphical, so the container needs a GUI. They want this running on Proxmox, which is typically a server, but maybe they have a local machine to host it or another setup where the container is accessible via remote desktop.

Considering macOS: I know that running macOS in containers isn't straightforward because of licensing and compatibility issues. You can't legally run macOS in a container unless you're using something like a hackintosh, which might not be supported. So maybe macOS inside Proxmox is tricky or impossible without violating terms of service or software licenses.

Linux seems more feasible. There are several options for Linux-based remote desktops that can run in containers. Xfce and LXQt come to mind because they're lightweight and suitable for a server environment where resources might be limited. I should look into whether these can be containerized, perhaps using LXD profiles or Docker.

Docker is another option. They can create a Docker container with a desktop environment like Xfce or LXQt, expose the necessary ports (like VNC or RDP), and then access it remotely. But since Proxmox already uses LXC/LXD for containers, maybe LXD is more integrated.

Persistent storage is crucial here. The user doesn't want to lose their configurations between sessions. So, the container's storage needs to be mapped to a host directory on Proxmox so that data persists even after the container restarts or stops.

For remote access, VNC might be easier because it's lightweight and can be tunneled securely if needed. RDP is also an option, but I think VNC is more commonly used in headless server setups.

So putting this together: Use a Linux distribution inside a Proxmox container with a light desktop environment like Xfce or LXQt. Ensure the home directory (or wherever the slicer software stores configs) is mapped to the host's storage for persistence. Set up VNC access so they can remotely connect to this desktop from their macOS machine.

Alternatively, Docker might offer more flexibility if they need specific software versions or isolation, but I think native LXD containers on Proxmox would integrate better without additional setup.

I should also consider performance. 3D printing slicer configurations might not be too resource-heavy, so a lightweight desktop environment is suitable. Network latency could affect the remote desktop experience, especially for graphical applications, but since it's local (Proxmox is likely on their LAN), that shouldn't be an issue.

In summary, I think the best approach is to create an LXD container on Proxmox using a lightweight Linux distro with a GUI, ensure persistent storage by binding mounts, and set up VNC access for remote management.

To address the need for a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, here's a structured approach:

### Solution Overview:
1. **Containerization Technology**: Utilize LXD containers native to Proxmox due to better integration and performance compared to Docker.
2. **Operating System Choice**: Use a lightweight Linux distribution as macOS is impractical in this context.
3. **Desktop Environment**: Choose Xfce or LXQt for their minimal resource usage, ideal for server environments.
4. **Persistent Storage**: Map container directories to host storage to ensure data persistence across sessions.
5. **Remote Access Protocol**: Implement VNC for remote desktop access due to its efficiency and ease of use in headless setups.

### Step-by-Step Setup:

1. **Container Creation**:
   - Create an LXD container on Proxmox using a lightweight Linux distribution such as Xubuntu or Ubuntu with the Xfce desktop environment.
   
2. **Desktop Environment Installation**:
   - Install either Xfce or LXQt within the container to provide a graphical interface suitable for remote access.

3. **Persistent Storage Configuration**:
   - Bind mount the necessary directories (e.g., home folder) from the host machine into the container to ensure that configurations and data persist across container restarts or shutdowns.

4. **Remote Desktop Setup**:
   - Install VNC server software within the container, such as `vncserver`.
   - Configure the VNC server to start automatically on boot and adjust settings for optimal remote access.

5. **Accessing the Remote Desktop**:
   - Use a VNC client (e.g., `vinagdi` or Remmina) on the macOS machine to connect to the container's IP address and port.
   - Optionally, tunnel through SSH for secure access if needed.

### Summary:
This setup provides a centralized, persistent environment for 3D printing workflows using LXD containers with a lightweight Linux desktop. The use of VNC ensures easy remote management from macOS, avoiding configuration syncing across multiple machines.
