Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to run on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. The user prefers macOS but is open to Linux or Windows. They want to avoid syncing configurations across machines by centralizing everything in a local remote desktop.

First, I need to understand what exactly they're looking for. They want a containerized solution because containers are lightweight and portable, which makes sense for managing workflows consistently without having to sync settings everywhere. Proxmox is their virtualization platform of choice, so the solution has to integrate well with that.

They mentioned 3D printing slicer configuration as an example workflow. This likely involves running specific software likecura's slicing software, maybe OctoPrint for monitoring prints, and other related tools. These applications might have dependencies or require specific environments, which is where containers come in handy because they can encapsulate all necessary components.

The user prefers macOS but is open to alternatives. So ideally, the solution would provide a Mac environment, but if that's not feasible, Linux or Windows options should be considered as well. Since Proxmox supports various operating systems on its nodes, it might be possible to run different container setups depending on what works best.

I know that Docker is a popular containerization tool, and with Proxmox, they can use LXC containers which are lightweight compared to full virtual machines. Alternatively, running Docker within an LXC container could provide more flexibility if needed.

For the remote desktop part, they need something that allows them to access the environment remotely but also feel like they're using a local machine. Maybe VNC or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) solutions would work here. If they prefer macOS, maybe using something like macOS within a Docker container and then accessing it via RDP or another remote desktop protocol.

I'm thinking about different options for containerized remote desktops:

1. **Docker with Xfce or LXQt**: Using a lightweight Linux distro in a Docker container with a GUI that can be accessed via VNC. This would provide a consistent environment and is relatively easy to set up on Proxmox.

2. **macOS in a Docker Container**: I'm not sure if this is straightforward because macOS isn't designed to run in containers like Linux distributions are. It might require more resources and possibly some hacky solutions, which could complicate things.

3. **Windows Subsystem for Docker**: Similar to the macOS option, running Windows in a container might not be ideal either. Plus, Proxmox on Linux would need to host Windows containers, which might have compatibility issues or performance overhead.

4. **LXC Containers with GUIs**: Using LXC to create lightweight VM-like environments that can host full OS instances, including macOS or Windows if possible. However, I think getting macOS to run in an LXC container isn't standard because macOS is a separate ecosystem requiring its own hypervisor, which Proxmox doesn't natively support.

5. **RDP-based Solutions**: Maybe using something like Guacamole as a remote desktop gateway that can host different environments, allowing access through RDP or VNC. This could provide flexibility across OS preferences.

Considering all this, the most practical approach seems to be using Docker with a lightweight Linux distro and a GUI, accessed via VNC. Since macOS is preferred but might not be feasible in a container, focusing on Linux would make more sense for Proxmox. Tools like Xfce or LXQt are minimalistic and resource-efficient, making them suitable for remote desktop environments.

They also mentioned persistent workflows, which means the environment needs to retain data across sessions. Docker volumes can handle this by mapping host directories into containers, ensuring that configuration files and slicer settings stay consistent.

Additionally, automation and orchestration with tools like Ansible or Salt could help in managing configurations centrally, reducing the need to sync settings manually across machines. CI/CD pipelines might be overkill unless they're already using them, but scripting and scheduled jobs are more straightforward for maintaining consistency.

In summary, the best approach is likely Docker on Proxmox with a lightweight Linux desktop environment connected via VNC or RDP, supplemented by proper volume management and automation scripts to handle persistence and configuration management.

To address the need for a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that supports persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, the optimal solution combines Docker containers with a lightweight Linux GUI accessed remotely. Here's a structured approach:

### Solution Overview:
1. **Containerization with Docker**: Utilize Docker to create isolated environments, ensuring consistent application setups and dependencies.
2. **Lightweight Linux Desktop Environment**: Use a minimalistic desktop like Xfce or LXQt within a Docker container for efficiency and ease of use.
3. **Remote Access via VNC/RDP**: Set up remote access using VNC (preferred) or RDP to manage the environment from any machine.
4. **Persistence with Docker Volumes**: Map host directories into containers to maintain configurations and data across sessions.
5. **Automation Tools**: Implement scripting and scheduled jobs for configuration management, reducing manual sync efforts.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Docker Installation**:
   - Install Docker on your Proxmox node to leverage containerization capabilities.

2. **Desktop Environment Setup**:
   - Pull a lightweight Linux image (e.g., `docker.io/debian:latest`).
   - Install Xfce or LXQt within the container for a GUI environment.
   
3. **Remote Desktop Configuration**:
   - Use VNC by installing `tightvncserver` in the container.
   - Configure it to start automatically on boot and access it via `vncviewer`.

4. **Persistent Storage**:
   - Mount host directories into the Docker container using `-v` flags during `docker run`.
   - Ensure slicer configurations, print files, and logs are stored in these volumes.

5. **Automation for Workflow Management**:
   - Use shell scripts to automate backup and restore of configuration files.
   - Schedule jobs with cron to periodically check and update workflows as needed.

6. **Advanced Configuration (Optional)**:
   - Consider `guacamole` as a remote desktop gateway for managing multiple environments.
   - Explore Ansible or SaltStack for orchestration if workflow complexity increases.

### Conclusion:
This setup provides a consistent, efficient, and persistent environment for managing 3D printing workflows on Proxmox. By focusing on Docker with Linux desktops and leveraging remote access tools, you achieve the desired centralized management without syncing configurations across devices.
