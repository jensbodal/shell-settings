Okay, so the user wants to set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox to manage persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. They prefer macOS but are open to Linux or Windows. The main goal is to avoid syncing configs between machines by centralizing the workflow locally. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to recall what Proxmox is. It's a Linux-based virtualization platform that supports KVM and LXC containers. So, the user wants to use containers, not VMs, probably because containers are lighter and easier to manage. But wait, remote desktop environments usually require a full OS, so maybe they're using a container to run a desktop environment? Or maybe they're using a container to run the application within a VM?

Wait, Proxmox can run containers (LXC) or VMs (KVM). Containers are more lightweight, but running a full desktop environment in a container might be tricky. Let me think. For example, using a container to run a Linux desktop environment like XFCE or GNOME might be possible, but there might be some limitations. Alternatively, maybe they want to run a VM with a desktop OS inside a container? No, that doesn't make sense. Containers are more about process isolation, not full OS virtualization. So perhaps they need a VM for the desktop environment, but they want to containerize the application or the workflow?

Wait, the user mentioned "containerized remote desktop environment". Maybe they're using a container to run a remote desktop server, like xrdp or something similar, which then connects to a VM or another container. Or maybe they're using a container that already includes a desktop environment and allows remote access.

Alternatively, maybe they're looking for a way to have persistent workspaces in containers, where the 3D slicer application runs inside the container, and they can access it via RDP or VNC. But for macOS, that might be more complex. Let me think about the options.

First, let's consider the operating system. The user prefers macOS, but Linux or Windows is acceptable. For macOS, containerization is more challenging. Apple doesn't support containers like LXC or Docker for macOS natively, so running macOS in a container on Proxmox might not be straightforward. However, there might be workarounds, like using a VM with macOS, but that's not a container. So perhaps the user is okay with Linux or Windows in a container.

If they go with Linux, then using a container with a desktop environment (like XFCE or GNOME) and then using VNC or RDP to access it. Alternatively, using a container that runs a remote desktop server, like X11 forwarding, but that's more for Unix apps. For a full desktop experience, maybe they need a VM with a desktop OS, but the user wants to containerize the environment.

Wait, maybe they're looking for a way to have persistent configurations in a container, so that when they access the remote desktop, all their settings are saved in the container. So, the idea is to have a container that runs the desktop environment (or the application) and allows remote access, with persistent storage for configurations.

So, for macOS, maybe using a container isn't feasible, but for Linux or Windows, it's possible. Let's break it down.

For Linux, using LXC containers with a desktop environment. But LXC containers have some limitations. For example, they need to have the host kernel features, and some desktop environments might not run properly in containers. Alternatively, using a VM with a Linux OS, then running a desktop environment inside, and then accessing it via RDP or VNC. But that's a VM, not a container. However, the user wants containerized.

Alternatively, maybe using Docker with a desktop environment. But Docker containers are more for applications, not full desktops. However, there are projects like "Docker Desktop" for Windows, but that's not a container. Wait, maybe using Docker with a Linux container that runs a desktop environment. But again, this might be complex and not very stable.

Another option is to use a container that runs a remote desktop server. For example, running a Windows container with RDP, or a Linux container with xrdp or noVNC. But for macOS, it's tricky. If the user is okay with Linux, then maybe a Linux container with a desktop environment and RDP access.

But let's think about the 3D printing slicer. Slicers like Cura, PrusaSlicer, etc., are usually run on Windows or macOS. If the user prefers macOS, but can't run it in a container, maybe they can run it in a VM with macOS, but that's not containerized. Alternatively, run it in a Linux container with a macOS compatibility layer? That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe they can use a virtual machine with macOS, but that's not a container. So perhaps the user is okay with Linux or Windows. If they go with Linux, then using a container with a desktop environment and RDP access. But how to set that up in Proxmox?

Proxmox can run LXC containers. So, the steps would be: create an LXC container with a Linux distribution, install a desktop environment, then set up a remote desktop server (like xrdp or vinagre), then access it via RDP. But maybe the user wants to have persistent data, so the container's storage is persistent.

Alternatively, using a VM with a Linux OS, then running the desktop environment and remote desktop server. But again, that's a VM, not a container. However, the user might be okay with VMs if containers aren't suitable. But the question specifically says "containerized".

Another angle: maybe using a container to run the 3D slicer application, but not the full desktop environment. For example, running the slicer in a container, and then accessing it via a web interface or something. But that's not a remote desktop environment.

Wait, the user wants a remote desktop environment. So they need a full desktop session. So, for that, the container needs to have a desktop environment and a way to remote into it. For Linux, that's possible with xrdp or VNC.

So, for example, create an LXC container with Ubuntu, install XFCE, then install xrdp, then access it via RDP. That would be a containerized remote desktop environment.

But for macOS, it's more complicated. Maybe using a VM with macOS, but that's not a container. However, there are projects like macOS in a container using Docker or LXC, but they require some hacking and might not be stable. For example, some people have tried to run macOS in a container using a modified kernel, but that's not officially supported and could be illegal or unstable.

Therefore, the user might have to compromise on macOS and go with Linux or Windows. If they go with Windows, then using an LXC container with Windows, but Proxmox doesn't support Windows containers natively. Wait, Proxmox can run KVM VMs, but for containers, LXC is limited to Linux. So, for Windows, they would need to run a VM with Windows, which is possible in Proxmox.

So, if they go with Windows, they can have a VM with Windows, install the remote desktop server (like RDP), and then access it. But the user might want it to be containerized. However, since Proxmox doesn't support Windows containers, that's not possible. Therefore, the best approach might be to use a VM for Windows or Linux, and then use that as the remote desktop environment.

But the user specifically asked for containerized. So, perhaps they are okay with using a VM for the remote desktop environment but want to containerize the workflow. Wait, the question says "containerized remote desktop environment to run on Proxmox". So the remote desktop environment itself is in a container. So, for Linux, that's possible. For Windows, not in a container, but in a VM.

So, the options are:

1. For Linux: LXC container with desktop environment and RDP access.
2. For Windows: KVM VM with Windows and RDP.
3. For macOS: Not possible in a container on Proxmox, so either VM or other methods.

But the user prefers macOS. If they can't use a container, maybe they can run macOS in a VM, which is possible with Proxmox, but that's a VM, not a container. However, the user might be okay with that.

But the question is about containerized. So, perhaps the answer is to use a Linux container for the remote desktop environment, which is easier to manage and persistent.

So, for the 3D printing slicer, if they're using Linux, they can install the slicer in the container, and have persistent storage for the configurations. For example, using a container with XFCE and xrdp, then accessing it via R, and running the slicer there. The configurations would be stored in the container's persistent storage, so they don't have to sync between machines.

Alternatively, if they use a VM with Linux, same idea. But the user wants containerization.

So, the best containerized option would be a Linux container with a desktop environment and RDP access. For macOS, it's not feasible in a container, so maybe they have to use a VM.

But the user might be open to Windows. Let's think about that. If they go with Windows, they can create a KVM VM with Windows, install the remote desktop server (which is built-in for Windows), then access it via RDP. The configurations would be stored in the VM's disk, which is persistent. So that's another option.

But the user mentioned "containerized", so maybe they want the VM to be in a container? That's not possible. So, perhaps the answer is to use a Linux container for the remote desktop environment, and if macOS is needed, use a VM.

Alternatively, maybe using a container to run the 3D slicer application, and then have a separate remote desktop environment. But that's not the same as a remote desktop environment.

So, the user's main goal is to avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing the workflow in a local remote desktop. So, they want to have a single instance where all configurations are stored, and they can access it remotely.

In that case, the best approach is to use a VM (for macOS or Windows) or a container (for Linux) that hosts the remote desktop environment and the necessary applications (like the 3D slicer). The container or VM would have persistent storage, so configurations are saved there.

But the user specifically asked for containerized. So, for Linux, LXC container with desktop and RDP. For macOS, maybe using a VM.

So, the answer would be to use a Linux container with a desktop environment and RDP access for the remote desktop, allowing the user to run the 3D slicer there, with persistent configurations. If macOS is needed, a VM would be the way to go, even though it's not a container.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use Docker with a Linux container that includes a desktop environment. For example, using a Docker image that has XFCE and xrdp, then exposing the RDP port. That would be a containerized remote desktop environment.

Yes, that's possible. So, the user could set up a Docker container with a Linux desktop, install xrdp, and then access it via RDP. Since Proxmox can run Docker containers (if they have Docker installed), that's an option.

But Proxmox's LXC containers can also run Docker containers within them. So, the user could have an LXC container with a Linux distribution, install Docker, then run a Docker container with the desktop environment. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, just use an LXC container with a desktop environment and RDP. That's simpler.

So, the best containerized remote desktop environment for Proxmox would be a Linux container with a desktop environment (like XFCE) and RDP access. For macOS, it's not feasible in a container, so a VM would be needed. But the user prefers macOS. So, they might have to use a VM with macOS, even though it's not containerized.

But the user might not mind using a VM if it's the only option. So, the answer would be to use a Linux container for the remote desktop environment, and for macOS, a VM.

But the user might want to avoid syncing between machines, so using a VM or container with persistent storage would allow them to centralize the configurations.

Another point: the user wants to run persistent workflows. So, the container or VM needs to have persistent storage. In Proxmox, containers can have persistent storage by using volumes. So, the configurations would be stored in the container's volume, so even if the container is stopped or restarted, the data remains.

Therefore, the best options are:

- For Linux: LXC container with XFCE and xrdp, persistent storage.
- For macOS: KVM VM with macOS, persistent storage.
- For Windows: KVM VM with Windows, persistent storage.

But the user prefers macOS. So, the answer would be to use a KVM VM with macOS for the remote desktop environment, but that's not containerized. However, if they can't use macOS in a container, that's the way to go.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to run macOS in a container using some workaround, but that's not recommended and may not be stable.

So, the conclusion is that for macOS, the best option is a VM, but for Linux, a containerized remote desktop environment is possible. If the user is open to Linux, then the container approach is better, as it's more lightweight and easier to manage. If they really need macOS, a VM is the way to go.

Therefore, the answer should recommend using a Linux container with a desktop environment and RDP for containerized remote desktop, and for macOS, a VM. Also, mention that macOS in a container is not feasible on Proxmox.

To achieve a **containerized remote desktop environment** on **Proxmox** for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, with a preference for **macOS** (but open to Linux/Windows), here's a structured solution:

---

### **1. Containerized Remote Desktop for Linux (Recommended)**
**Best Option**: Use a **Linux container** with a desktop environment and RDP/VNC access. This is the most lightweight and scalable approach on Proxmox.

#### **Steps**:
- **Proxmox LXC Container**:
  - Create an LXC container with a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
  - Install a desktop environment (e.g., XFCE or GNOME) and a remote desktop server (e.g., `xrdp` for RDP or `tigervnc`/`noVNC` for VNC).
  - Example:  
    ```bash
    apt update && apt install xfce4 xrdp
    systemctl enable xrdp
    ```
  - Mount persistent storage for configurations (e.g., `/home/user/slicer_configs`).

- **Access via RDP/VNC**:
  - Connect via RDP (Windows) or VNC (Linux/macOS) to the container.
  - Run 3D slicers (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer) inside the container, with configurations stored in the persistent volume.

- **Advantages**:
  - Lightweight and easy to manage.
  - Persistent storage for workflows.
  - No need to sync configurations between machines.

---

### **2. macOS Workaround (Not Containerized)**
**Option**: Use a **KVM VM** with macOS for remote desktop access. While not containerized, it’s the only viable option for macOS on Proxmox.

#### **Steps**:
- **KVM VM with macOS**:
  - Use a macOS virtual machine (e.g., macOS Catalina or newer) via Proxmox’s KVM.
  - Install a remote desktop solution like **Microsoft Remote Desktop** (for macOS) or **XQuartz** (for X11 forwarding).
  - Share the VM’s disk as a persistent volume to store slicer configurations.

- **Access via RDP or VNC**:
  - Use macOS-native tools (e.g., Screen Sharing) or third-party RDP clients to access the VM.

- **Note**: macOS in a VM is not ideal due to licensing and performance constraints, but it’s the only way to run macOS on Proxmox.

---

### **3. Windows Alternative (KVM VM)**
**Option**: Use a **KVM VM with Windows** for remote desktop access. This is straightforward and supports macOS-based slicers (e.g., via Wine).

#### **Steps**:
- **KVM VM with Windows**:
  - Install a Windows VM (e.g., Windows 10/11).
  - Use built-in RDP for remote access.
  - Install 3D slicers (e.g., Cura, Slic3r) and store configurations in the VM’s persistent disk.

- **Advantages**:
  - Native support for Windows applications.
  - No containerization required.

---

### **4. macOS in a Container (Not Recommended)**
**Note**: Running macOS in a container on Proxmox is **not supported** by Apple and involves significant technical hurdles (e.g., kernel modifications, legal issues). Avoid this approach unless you have specific needs.

---

### **Summary**
| **Requirement**         | **Recommended Solution**                     | **Notes**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **macOS**               | **KVM VM with macOS**                       | Not containerized but necessary for macOS workflows.                     |
| **Linux**               | **LXC Container with XFCE/xrdp**            | Lightweight, persistent, and fully containerized.                        |
| **Windows**             | **KVM VM with Windows**                     | Native RDP support; ideal for Windows-based slicers.                    |
| **Persistent Workflows**| **Persistent Storage in Volumes**           | Use Proxmox volumes to store slicer configurations.                      |

---

### **Final Recommendation**
- **Prefer Linux** for a fully containerized, lightweight solution with persistent workflows.
- **Use macOS in a VM** if macOS is critical, accepting the trade-off of not being containerized.
- **Avoid macOS in containers** due to technical and legal limitations.
