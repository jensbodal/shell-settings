⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠼ ⠴ ⠦ ⠧ ⠇ To achieve a centralized and persistent workflow for tasks like 3D printer configuration using Proxmox as your virtualization platform, you can use containerized remote desktop solutions. Here are some options that you might consider:

### Container Options

1. **Docker with X2Go or TigerVNC:**
   - **Linux Containers:** You can set up a Linux-based environment (e.g., Ubuntu) inside Docker and configure it to serve as your workstation.
     - Use **X2Go** for better performance over VNC, especially if you have access to OpenGL hardware acceleration. X2Go provides a more responsive experience compared to traditional VNC solutions and is particularly suitable for tasks involving graphical applications like 3D printing slicers.
     - Alternatively, **TigerVNC** can be used if you need something lightweight or are working with environments that don't support X2Go.

   - **Setup Steps:**
     1. Create a Docker container running your preferred Linux distribution.
     2. Install necessary applications like Blender or Cura for 3D printing slicer configuration inside the container.
     3. Set up X2Go Server or TigerVNC Server within the container.
     4. Expose the necessary ports and configure Proxmox to forward these ports appropriately.

2. **Windows Containers:**
   - If you prefer a Windows-based environment, you can use Docker with Windows containers.
   - Tools like **RDP** (Remote Desktop Protocol) or VNC solutions tailored for Windows can be used inside the container.
   - This setup would allow running applications like Fusion 360 if they are better suited to your needs.

3. **macOS via Virtualization:**
   - While not directly supported as a containerized solution due to licensing and technical constraints, you can create a macOS VM on Proxmox and access it using tools like **Remote Desktop (RDP)** or **VNC**.
   - This approach will be more resource-intensive but provides a full macOS experience.

### Recommended Approach

Given your requirements and the flexibility of Linux containers with Docker, setting up an Ubuntu container with X2Go is likely the best option. It offers a good balance between performance, ease of setup, and compatibility with graphical applications:

- **Ubuntu Container with X2Go:**
  - Install X2Go server in the Ubuntu container.
  - Configure your Proxmox firewall to allow access to the X2Go port (default is 22 for SSH).
  - Use an X2Go client on any machine (Windows, macOS, or Linux) to connect.

### Advantages of Using Docker and X2Go:

- **Performance:** X2Go provides a smoother experience compared to traditional VNC, especially when dealing with OpenGL applications.
- **Portability:** Containers can be easily backed up, migrated, or replicated across systems.
- **Isolation:** Each container is isolated from the host system, reducing security risks.

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure your Proxmox and container setup has sufficient resources allocated to handle graphical tasks efficiently.
- Regularly back up the container configuration to prevent data loss.

By setting up a Docker-based environment with X2Go on Proxmox, you can create a robust, persistent remote desktop solution tailored for managing 3D printing workflows without needing to sync configurations across multiple devices.
