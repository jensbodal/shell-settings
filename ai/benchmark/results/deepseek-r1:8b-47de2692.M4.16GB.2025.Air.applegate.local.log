Okay, so I need to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment that can run on Proxmox. The user wants to manage persistent workflows, specifically things like configuring 3D printing slicers. They prefer macOS but are open to Linux or Windows too. The main goal is to avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing everything locally in a remote desktop setup.

First, I should think about what containerization means here. Containers are great for encapsulating applications and their dependencies, making it easy to manage environments consistently across different machines. Proxmox is a solid platform for container orchestration, so that's a good start.

The user mentioned persistent workflows, which implies that data and configurations shouldn't disappear when the session ends or the machine reboots. So whatever solution we use needs to handle persistence effectively. That probably means using something like Redis for data storage within the containers.

Now, considering macOS preference but also allowing Linux or Windows: I know that Proxmox runs on Linux, so cross-platform support might be a challenge. Maybe Docker is the way to go because it can run on all major platforms, including Proxmox's underlying Linux. Alternatively, containerization with Docker Compose could allow for multi-machine setups if needed.

I should think about specific tools or frameworks that are good for 3D printing slicers. Printrun, Slic3r, and Cura are common ones. Using these within containers can help manage their configurations centrally. Maybe setting up a centralized configuration storage using a volume or a mounted directory where all users access the same settings.

Centralization is key here. By having a central store, when someone logs in, they get their personalized settings without needing to sync across machines. So perhaps using a home directory that's persisted within Proxmox, maybe via /home/user or another mount point, so that each user has their own config files stored there.

Another aspect is authentication and access control. Each user should have secure access to their specific settings. Maybe integrating some form of Single Sign-On (SSO) if needed, but at least ensuring that configurations are tied to user accounts rather than being shared or accessible by others.

I also need to consider performance. 3D printing can be resource-heavy, so the container environment must handle graphics rendering properly. Perhaps using virtualization alongside containers might help with performance, but I'm not entirely sure how that would work on Proxmox.

Looking into existing solutions, maybe something like V2D (Virtualized 2D) or NoMachine's WVD (Windows Virtual Desktop) could be integrated with Proxmox. These platforms support remote desktops and can be containerized to an extent. Alternatively, Proxmox itself has some built-in support for desktop environments.

I should also think about backup and disaster recovery. If the configuration is centralized, having automated backups of the containers and their data would be important in case something goes wrong.

Putting it all together, here's what I'm thinking:

1. Use Docker or containerization within Proxmox to encapsulate 3D printing applications.
2. Store user configurations in a persistent volume, maybe using Redis or a mounted directory.
3. Centralize these configurations so that each user gets their own settings upon login.
4. Use tools like Docker Compose for multi-container setups if needed.
5. Ensure remote access through a desktop environment supported by Proxmox, possibly using NoMachine or another solution.
6. Implement secure authentication methods to prevent unauthorized access.

I might be missing some details here, but this seems like a solid foundation. Now I should consider if there are any specific tools or libraries that can help with this setup, and maybe look into examples of similar implementations.

To establish an optimal containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent 3D printing workflows, follow these steps:

### 1. **Containerization Setup**
   - **Choose a Containerization Tool**: Use Docker or another containerization tool compatible with Proxmox to encapsulate applications like Printrun, Slic3r, and Cura.
   - **Persistent Storage**: Utilize Redis for data storage within containers to ensure configurations persist across sessions.

### 2. **Centralized Configuration**
   - **User Home Directories**: Store user configurations in a persistent home directory (e.g., `/home/user/`), ensuring each user has access to their specific settings.
   - **Multi-Machine Support**: Use Docker Compose for multi-container setups if cross-machine access is needed, but ensure central storage prevents syncing.

### 3. **Remote Desktop Integration**
   - **Proxmox Features**: Leverage Proxmox's capabilities for remote desktops, possibly using built-in support or integrating with tools like NoMachine or V2D.
   - **Authentication & Security**: Implement secure SSO and access controls to ensure only authorized users access centralized settings.

### 4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize resource management for graphics-heavy tasks, considering virtualization solutions alongside containers if necessary.

### 5. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Automate backups of containerized data using Proxmox's tools to ensure recovery in case of issues.

### 6. **Tools and Libraries**
   - Explore tools like Docker Compose and libraries for managing application dependencies and configurations.

By following these steps, you can create a centralized, persistent, and secure remote desktop environment tailored for 3D printing workflows on Proxmox.
