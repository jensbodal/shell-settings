⠙ ⠹ ⠸ When looking for an optimal containerized environment on Proxmox (which supports KVM guests) that allows you to manage persistent data like macOS configuration files from your slicer, while also being capable of running complex applications such as Slic3r or Cura without frequent synchronization issues, consider using a Linux-based desktop. Here's why:

1. **Compatibility** - Most 3D printer software is designed with support for various operating systems primarily focusing on Windows and Unix/Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu). MacOS has some compatibility but may not be the main focus or supported in depth compared to Linux-based options, especially when it comes to slicer configurations which are often shared between machines.

2. **Network File System** - Implement a Network File System (NFS) on your Proxmox server for persistent storage of configuration files and machine settings without frequent synchronization needed as you would with SSH-tunnel or personal file sharing solutions like Dropbox, which might slow down the workflow if used in large data.

3. **Choosing a Linux Desktop Environment**: Lightweight desktop environments such as LXDE (Lightweight X Display Environment) are suitable for containerized setups due to their lower resource requirements and ease of setup within containers on KVM guests. Since your work will involve 3D printing software, you might want an environment that can run well with command-line tools or GUI applications like Cura or Slic3r without causing performance bottlenecks when running inside a containerized system due to CPU/RAM limitations of Proxmox instances within KVM guests.

   - **Linux Desktop**: Install your preferred Linux distribution on the guest VM, ensuring it has all necessary dependencies for 3D printing software and GUI applications if required (e.g., Ubuntu Server or another lightweight distro). You can use Docker containers to run specific tools that might be resource-intensive while keeping these within a contained environment where settings are shared via NFS shares rather than SSH tunnels, making this less likely for configuration sync issues during long workflows between machines without heavy I/O.
   
   - **LXDE**: As an example of setting up LXDE with your chosen Linux distro in the containerized environment might look something like this when installing it via Dockerfile or similar means, though specific commands will vary by distribution and version you choose to run on Proxmox. Your Docker setup would also need volumes attached for NFS mounts where persistent data resides:
      ```Dockerfile
      FROM ubuntu:20.04 as builder  # Example using Ubuntu; change according needed distro & maintainer scripts or patches if any required  
      
      RUN apt-get update && \
        DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y software-properties-common lxde curl x11viewer nano procps vim sudo python3 pip jq gnome-tweak-tool ttf-mscorefonts-installer bc \
        && add-apt-repository ppa:ubiquity/apps # Adds CURA and Slic3r repositories  
      
      RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y cura curaslice cron curl ca-certificates libnss3 default-jre sudo python3 python3-pip jq \
        # Additional dependencies for CURA and Slic3r might be required  
      
      RUN pip install --upgrade pip && apt-get update -y  # Required in case of multiple packages to upgrade/install, though this may not always apply. Replace with appropriate package manager commands based on the Linux distro chosen for your guest VM setup.    
      
      VOLUME ["/config", "/usr"]
      RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y nfs-common \
        # Install NFS services on the host system or container orchestrator if it supports installing service definitions in containers.  
        
      CMD ["/usr/sbin/lightdm","--session"]  # Replace this with a command that starts your chosen desktop environment and opens an X session, for instance: startx but ensure Docker user has access to the proper DISPLAY or network-shared one configured as per NFS setup.  
      ```
   
4. **Proxmox Tools** (if necessary): Utilize tools such as `podman` which is a Linux container runtime similar to Docker, and integrates well with Proxmox for running containers on your VMs without leaving the host system's network namespace unless explicitly desired through bridge networking configurations between hosts/guests.

Here are additional considerations: Ensure that you have SSH access configured securely within your KVM guests if not using NFS, as this might be necessary to manage containerized environments remotely or transfer large configuration files at times when the network connection is down and direct connectivity isn't available due to limitations on a cloud provider without NAT support for containers.

This setup provides flexibility in your workflow by allowing you to switch between Linux, Windows via Hyper-V (or similar if running Proxmox) guest VMs easily with containerization technology like Docker or Podman while keeping persistent configurations managed through shared NFS directories on the host where resources are centrally stored for slicer configuration files and machine settings. 

Always remember to test your workflow in a separate environment before deploying it into production, as this setup may not be ideal with every specific use case or software requirement but should provide an efficient way of handling persistent configurations without sync issues while managing complex applications from remote desktops using containerization technologies.
