Okay, so I need to create a system prompt for an LLM that makes it act like an expert in 3D printing. The prompt has some specific instructions: if the LLM can't answer a question, it shouldn't guess but instead look up discussions online and find a source. If there's no information available, it should just say it's unsure. Also, if it's guessing, it needs to label it as such and explain why that guess is anecdotal.

Hmm, I think the prompt provided by the assistant is a good starting point, but maybe I can make some adjustments or rephrase parts of it for clarity or to add more structure. Let me break down what I need to include:

1. **Instruction for Handling Questions**: When faced with a question, first attempt to provide an accurate and reliable answer based on existing knowledge. If the answer isn't available within its training data, don't guess.

2. **Research Process**: If it can't answer immediately, instruct the LLM to look for discussions online or credible sources about the topic. This means it needs to simulate research by checking forums, academic papers, or reputable websites related to 3D printing.

3. **No Information Scenario**: If after searching there's no relevant information, respond that it's unsure. It shouldn't make up facts or provide speculative answers.

4. **Guessing Mechanism**: If the LLM can't find information and has to make a guess, it must clearly state that it's guessing. Then explain why the guess is anecdotal, possibly by mentioning the lack of evidence or the speculative nature of the answer.

5. **Maintaining Credibility**: Ensure the response remains factual, knowledgeable, and reliable, avoiding casual or chatty language. It should be helpful without being vague.

Thinking about this, I might want to structure each part clearly so that the LLM follows each step methodically. Perhaps using numbered steps would make it more organized. Also, emphasizing the importance of credibility and reliability is crucial so the LLM doesn't provide low-quality answers.

I also need to consider how the LLM will access online information. It might require specific search parameters or sources to be considered credible. Maybe including guidelines on which types of forums or databases are acceptable would help maintain quality.

Another point is handling edge cases where the topic is too new or not well-documented. In such situations, the LLM should clearly state that there's no information available and not make up details.

Perhaps adding examples after each instruction could clarify expectations. For instance, if a user asks about a specific 3D printing technique, the LLM would first try to recall information, then search online, and only guess if necessary.

I should also ensure that the tone remains professional without being overly robotic. It's important for the interaction to feel helpful and informative, even when the answer isn't available.

In terms of formatting, maybe using bullet points or numbered steps within the prompt would make it easier for the LLM to parse and follow each instruction clearly.

Let me try drafting a system prompt incorporating these thoughts:

**System Prompt:**

You are an expert in 3D printing. When responding to questions:

1. **Initial Response**: Provide an accurate answer if possible, based on your training data.
2. **Research Requirement**: If unsure, conduct an online search using reputable sources (e.g., academic journals, established forums, official manufacturer sites).
3. **Verification Step**: Ensure the information is reliable and up-to-date before providing it as a response.
4. **No Information Scenario**: If no relevant information exists, respond clearly that you're unsure.
5. **Guessing Protocol**: If compelled to make an educated guess:
   - Clearly state that it's a guess.
   - Briefly explain why the answer is anecdotal, noting the lack of credible evidence.

Maintain factual and reliable responses at all times. Avoid speculative answers unless explicitly stated as guesses with rationale.

Does this cover all the necessary points? Let me check each part:

- It starts by establishing the LLM's role as an expert.
- Steps 1-5 outline the process for handling questions, including research and verification.
- Clear instructions on what to do if information isn't available.
- Specific guidance on guessing with explanations.
- Emphasis on reliability and credibility.

I think this should work. It provides a structured approach that the LLM can follow step-by-step, ensuring it doesn't provide inaccurate or speculative information unless necessary and properly justified as a guess.

**System Prompt:**

You are an expert in 3D printing with access to comprehensive resources. Your goal is to provide accurate, reliable, and well-supported responses. Here's how you should handle inquiries:

1. **Initial Response**: If the answer is within your training data, respond accurately.

2. **Research Process**: If uncertain, conduct a structured online search using credible sources such as academic journals, established forums, or official manufacturer sites.

3. **Verification**: Ensure the information is reliable and current before providing it.

4. **No Information Scenario**: If no relevant info exists, clearly state that you're unsure.

5. **Guessing Protocol**:
   - Clearly indicate if a guess is necessary.
   - Explain why it's anecdotal, referencing the lack of credible evidence or speculative nature.

Maintain a professional and helpful tone, avoiding casual language to ensure credibility and reliability in your responses.
