Okay, so I need to create a system prompt for an LLM that makes it act as an expert in 3D printing. The user has provided a sample prompt, but they want me to go through the thought process of creating this.

First, let's understand what the system prompt should do. It needs to instruct the LLM to provide accurate and reliable information about 3D printing. If it can't answer a question directly, instead of guessing, it should search online for discussions or sources on the topic. If there's no available information, it should respond that it's unsure. Also, any guesses made by the LLM should be clearly labeled as such with reasons why they shouldn't be taken as factual.

So, how do I structure this prompt? It should probably start by setting the context—acting as an expert in 3D printing. Then outline the behavior when faced with a question: try to answer based on knowledge, if not possible, search for information online, and handle cases where no info is found or if it's making a guess.

I should also include instructions about how to format any online sources found—probably as citations—and emphasize that if the LLM doesn't know something, it shouldn't make up stories or just chat. It needs to remain factual and reliable.

Wait, maybe I should think about the language tone too. The prompt should be clear and authoritative without being condescending. It should guide the LLM to be precise and helpful, not vague or speculative.

Also, I need to ensure that if the LLM is unable to find information online after trying, it responds clearly that it's unsure. So there's no confusion about whether the information is reliable or not.

Putting this all together, the system prompt should have an introduction, behavior instructions for different scenarios (answer, search online, no info), and a conclusion reinforcing its role as a reliable expert.

Let me outline the structure:

1. **Introduction**: State that the LLM is acting as an expert in 3D printing.
2. **Behavior Instructions**:
   - If it knows the answer, provide it clearly.
   - If not, search online for discussions or sources.
   - If no info found, respond that it's unsure.
   - Any guesses must be labeled with reasons why they're not factual.
3. **Search Process**: Explain how to find information—look through relevant forums, databases, etc.—and cite sources properly.
4. **Reliability**: Emphasize that the LLM should avoid making up information or chatting idly; stick to facts and known data.

I think I have a good structure now. Let me draft this in clear, concise language without markdown, just plain text as per the user's request.

Wait, no markdown, but when the final response is given, the user expects it within **, so perhaps I should include that? Wait, the initial prompt didn't specify, but since they provided a sample with **, maybe that's acceptable. Or maybe not—wait, in their example, they used **, so probably yes.

Wait no, looking back, the user provided:

They have a sample output where the system prompt is within triple backticks. So perhaps the final answer should be enclosed in triple backticks as well.

So, I need to make sure that the system prompt I create is properly formatted with ** around it, but actually, looking at their example, they used triple backticks:

**System Prompt:**

"..."

Wait, no, their sample prompt starts with "The following system prompt..." and then explains. Hmm, perhaps just use triple backticks as in:

```
...
```

But to be consistent, maybe follow the same structure as their example.

Alternatively, I can check the exact format they want. Since the user provided a response that included a system prompt within **, but actually, looking again, in their initial question, the sample prompt is just plain text without any markdown. Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me see: the initial user message says "put your final answer within \boxed{}", so maybe I should present the system prompt as a boxed statement.

Wait, that might be confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the system prompt doesn't need to be boxed, but just written normally. But in their example response, they used ** around the system prompt title and then a blockquote with the actual prompt inside.

But in any case, I'll proceed by drafting the system prompt clearly and concisely, ensuring it meets all the specified requirements.

**System Prompt for 3D Printing Expert**

"Act as an expert in 3D printing. When presented with a question about 3D printing:

1. If you can provide an accurate and reliable answer based on your knowledge, do so clearly and precisely.
2. If the answer isn't readily available, search online for relevant discussions or sources in credible forums, databases, or academic papers.
3. If no information is found after a thorough search, respond that you are unsure about the topic.
4. Do not guess unless certain sources confirm the information; any guesses must be clearly labeled as such with reasons why they should be treated as anecdotes.

Seek out and cite reliable sources whenever possible, ensuring your responses are factual, knowledgeable, and trustworthy. Avoid conjecture or casual conversation; maintain professionalism and accuracy at all times."
