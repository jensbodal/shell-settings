⠙ Okay, let's break down the best containerized remote desktop environment for your needs, considering your preference for macOS and Linux/Windows, and the emphasis on persistent workflows. Here's a breakdown of options, ranked with strengths and weaknesses, focusing on your specific goals:

**Top Tier - Best Overall Choice**

* **Remmina (with Docker):** This is arguably the *best* starting point, and it’s incredibly versatile and readily available.
    * **Why it's good:**
        * **Docker-based:**  Remmina is built on Docker, making it extremely portable and easy to deploy across multiple Proxmox hosts. You can easily switch between hosts without complex configuration.
        * **macOS/Linux/Windows Support:**  Works with both macOS and Linux (with a bit of configuration). Windows support is a bit more involved (see below).
        * **Powerful:**  Includes a robust file manager, terminal, and mouse integration.
        * **Open Source:**  Totally free to use.
        * **VPN Support:**  Strong VPN support.
        * **Advanced Features:**  Supports SSH tunneling, remote command execution, and is highly configurable.
    * **Windows Support:** Requires a bit more effort, but you can set up a Windows VM and utilize Remmina through a configuration file.
    * **Cost:** Free!
    * **Complexity:** Moderate – requires a bit of initial setup but is very maintainable.

**Second Tier - Excellent, with Specific Considerations**

* **Xrdp:**  (Especially if you are fine with a very basic setup)
    * **Why it’s good:**
        * **Simplicity:** Xrdp is a lightweight RDP server that runs on various operating systems. It is very easy to install and manage.
        * **macOS/Linux/Windows Support:** Can be configured to run on multiple distributions.
        * **Good Performance:** Designed for low resource usage.
    * **Considerations:** It’s a minimal server, so you'll need to configure it carefully for your workflow. It might not have all the advanced features of Remmina.
    * **Cost:** Free and Open Source.

**Third Tier - Good, but requires more setup**

* **VNC Server (e.g., TightVNC, RealVNC, TigerVNC):**
    * **Why it's good:** VNC offers a flexible and reliable remote desktop experience.  It works natively on macOS and Linux.
    * **Considerations:**  Requires a dedicated VNC server to be installed on the Proxmox host, which adds an extra layer of complexity. It’s not a “managed” remote desktop, but more of a visual presentation of a terminal.
    * **Cost:** Free and Open Source.

**Fourth Tier – More complex, but potentially better for specific workflows**

* **Xrdp + Configuration Files (Advanced):** You could potentially use a streamlined configuration of Xrdp using a Linux-based tool for automating configuration and updates, and this can be further configured to work with a virtual machine.  This is the most advanced option.


**Recommendation - My Top Pick**

For your use case – persistent workflows, macOS/Linux/Windows support, and a focus on minimizing configuration – **Remmina (with Docker)** is the best starting point.  It offers the best combination of power, portability, ease of use, and cost.  It’s the most likely to keep your configuration manageable.

**Important Proxmox Considerations**

1. **Networking:**  Ensure you have a robust and well-configured network infrastructure between the Proxmox hosts.  Consider using a dedicated VLAN for the remote desktop to enhance security.

2. **Firewall:** Configure Proxmox’s firewall appropriately to allow the necessary traffic for Remmina/Xrdp.

3. **User Permissions:**  Carefully manage user permissions to ensure security.

4. **Resource Allocation:** Don’t over-provision resources for the remote desktop.

5. **Backup Strategy:** Implement a robust backup strategy for the remote desktop configuration.  (Think of a way to back up your settings so you don’t lose them if a host goes down.)


**To help me refine my recommendation even further, could you tell me:**

*   **What specific tasks will you primarily use the remote desktop for?** (e.g., 3D printing, CAD design, collaborative editing, etc.)
*   **What is your level of technical expertise?** (Are you comfortable with Docker, command-line configuration, etc.?)
*   **What is your ideal budget?** (Free? Willing to pay for a premium service?)
