⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠼ ⠼ ⠦  To achieve your goal of creating a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows, I would recommend using a combination of LXC (Linux Containers) or Docker (for more isolated environments), and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers for macOS, Linux, or Windows.

For macOS, you can use the open-source project called Coala-Desktop, which is an unofficial macOS port of the Alpine Linux distribution. To make it containerized, you can create an LXC or Docker container with this distribution installed and run a Remote Desktop server like X11vnc or VNC server for macOS.

For Windows, you can use Windows Server containers on Proxmox with RDP enabled. However, setting up a containerized Windows environment might be more complex than macOS.

For Linux, you can create an LXC or Docker container with your preferred Linux distribution and install a Remote Desktop server like X11vnc or VNC server.

Here's the step-by-step process to follow:

1. Install Proxmox on a host machine.
2. Create a new container based on Coala-Desktop (for macOS), your preferred Linux distribution, or Windows Server for Windows.
3. Install and configure the Remote Desktop server of your choice (X11vnc, VNC server, RDP server) in the container.
4. Set up RDP clients on your local machines to connect to the remote desktop environment running inside the container.
5. Configure your 3D printing slicer software and other applications within the container to centralize your workflow.
6. Save any configuration files or settings within the container, ensuring that they are persistent across container restarts.
7. Avoid syncing configurations between machines by only editing the configurations in the container.

By following these steps, you will have a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that centralizes your workflow and allows you to manage persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration without the need for synchronizing configurations between machines.
