⠋ ⠹  For your requirements, you can set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that allows you to run macOS, Linux, or Windows applications while centralizing your persistent workflows. I would recommend using a solution stack that includes LXC (Linux Containers) for containerization, Nginix as a reverse proxy, and VNC server (TightVNC for Windows, XQuartz for macOS, and VNC4Server for Linux) for remote access.

Here's an outline of the steps you can follow to set up this environment:

1. Install Proxmox on your server if you haven't already done so.
2. Create a new LXC container with the desired OS (macOS, Linux, or Windows) using templates provided by Proxmox. You may need to install additional tools like boot-scd and QEMU/KVM to use macOS templates on Proxmox.
3. Configure the LXC container:
   a. Assign an accessible IP address, port, or hostname for VNC access.
   b. Mount any necessary directories or volumes (e.g., shared folders for 3D printing configurations) inside the container.
   c. If required, adjust container settings to allocate more CPU and memory resources.
4. Install the VNC server on your LXC container:
   a. For macOS, install XQuartz and set up screen sharing in System Preferences > Sharing.
   b. For Windows, install TightVNC Server.
   c. For Linux distributions, you can use VNC4Server or any other preferred VNC server.
5. Configure Nginix as a reverse proxy to forward incoming VNC requests to the container:
   a. Install Nginix on your Proxmox host.
   b. Create a new configuration file for the LXC container, e.g., `/etc/nginx/conf.d/lxc-container.conf`, with the following contents:

```
server {
    listen 5901; # Replace this port with your chosen VNC listening port.
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://<LXC container IP address>:5900; # Replace this IP address with the one assigned to your LXC container.
    }
}
```
   c. Enable and start the Nginix service:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```
6. Access the remote desktop environment using a VNC client (e.g., TightVNC, RealVNC, or Chicken of the VNC) by connecting to the Proxmox host IP address and port 5901. You can also adjust your firewall settings to limit access to the remote desktop if needed.
7. Install your preferred 3D printing software on the LXC container (e.g., Cura, Ultimaker Cura, or PrusaSlicer) and configure it to store its profiles in a shared folder for easy access across multiple machines.
8. Enjoy a centralized workflow for managing your 3D printing configurations without the need for syncing between devices!
