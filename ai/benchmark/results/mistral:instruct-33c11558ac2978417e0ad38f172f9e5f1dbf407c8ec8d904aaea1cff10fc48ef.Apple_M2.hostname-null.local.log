⠙ ⠙ ⠸ ⠼ ⠼  For your requirements, you can create a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that supports macOS, Linux, and Windows. Here's an approach using LXC (Linux Containers) for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations.

1. **Install necessary packages**: First, ensure you have the `lxc` package installed on your Proxmox server:

   ```
   apt-get update && apt-get install lxc
   ```

2. **Create a new container**: Use the following command to create a new container with macOS or Linux/Windows as needed (you might need to adjust this command based on the OS template you choose). For example, if you want to use macOS, you can download the official macOS Big Sur template from LXC's GitHub page.

   ```
   lxc launch centos:7 container_name --cpu 2 --memory 4096M --device /dev/vda --device /dev/null --device /dev/zero --device /dev/random --device /dev/urandom --device /dev/rtc --device /dev/hpet --device /dev/input/event* --device /dev/dri --device /dev/kvm container_alias
   ```

   Replace `centos:7` with the desired OS template, and adjust other options according to your needs.

3. **Install required software**: Install VNC server in your newly created container (e.g., TightVNC Server for Windows, XQuartz for macOS).

4. **Configure VNC settings**: Set up the VNC viewer on your local machine to connect to this container. The IP address and port number can be found by running `lxc config show container_alias --format json | jq -r '.[0].config.lxc.network.eth0.ipv4'`.

5. **Install 3D printing slicer software**: Install the desired slicing software (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura, Simplify3D) inside your container based on its operating system.

6. **Persistent data storage**: To avoid syncing configurations between machines, store the slicer profiles and other necessary files in a shared folder accessible both from the host machine and the container (e.g., `/mnt/data` shared with host's directory `/mnt/data`).

7. **Access container via VNC**: Now you can access your container remotely using your preferred VNC client, where you can manage your 3D printing workflows without the need for syncing configurations between machines.
