⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠼ ⠼ ⠴  To achieve your goal of creating a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that supports macOS, Linux, and Windows for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, you can consider using Portainer with LXC containers and Remote Desktop (RDP/VNC) solutions. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install Docker and LXC on Proxmox:
   ```
   pvece-install docker
   pveum install lxc
   ```

2. Install Portainer:
   - Download the latest release from https://github.com/portainer/portainer/releases
   - Upload the portainer-ce.tgz file to your Proxmox storage (iso images).
   - Create a new LXC container using this template and set the following parameters:
      - Name: Portainer
      - Memory limit: 256MB
      - CPU cores: 1
      - Root password: Your_Proxmox_Root_Password
      - Enable auto-restart: Checked
      - Boot from template: Portainer (Uploaded earlier)
   - Start the container and set it to start automatically at boot.

3. Access Portainer:
   - In your Proxmox web UI, go to Containers > LXC > Portainer > Services tab.
   - Copy the IP address from the IPv4 address field.
   - Open a web browser and navigate to http://<IP_Address>:9000 (replace <IP_Address> with your container's IP address).
   - Login using admin as both username and password.
   - You can now create new applications (containers) for macOS, Linux, or Windows.

4. Configure the RDP/VNC server in your containers:
   - For macOS: Install CoRD (RDP server) via Homebrew, or use a macOS VM with a pre-installed RDP server like Parallels.
   - For Linux: Install TightVNC server or Xrdp.
   - For Windows: Install Remote Desktop Services or third-party VNC servers such as RealVNC.

5. Configure your containers to centralize the 3D printing workflow:
   - In each container, install the necessary slicer software and configure them according to your preferences.
   - To avoid syncing configurations between machines, save all configuration files on a shared network drive or cloud storage that can be accessed from the containers.
   - For better organization, create groups in Portainer to manage different projects or tasks more efficiently.
