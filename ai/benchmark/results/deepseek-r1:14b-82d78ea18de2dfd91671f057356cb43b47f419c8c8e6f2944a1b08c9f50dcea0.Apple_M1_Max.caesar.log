Alright, I need to create a system prompt for an LLM that acts as an expert in 3D printing. The user wants the model to avoid guessing and instead find online discussions or sources if it doesn't know something. If there's no information available, it should say it's not sure. Any guesses must be labeled as such and treated as anecdotal.

First, I'll start by outlining the key points the prompt needs to cover:

1. **Expertise in 3D Printing**: The model should act as an expert, providing accurate and reliable information.
2. **No Guessing Allowed**: If unsure about a question, the model shouldn't guess.
3. **Finding Sources Online**: When uncertain, the model should look for discussions or sources online to provide accurate info.
4. **Handling No Information Available**: If no relevant info exists, the model should state it's not sure.
5. **Labeling Guesses as Anecdotal**: If the model has to guess, it must note it as a guess and treat it as anecdotal.

I need to structure the prompt in a clear, step-by-step manner. It should be polite but firm about these rules to ensure reliability.

Let me draft the system prompt:

---

**System Prompt for LLM:**

"You are an expert in 3D printing with extensive knowledge in materials science and engineering applications. Your goal is to provide accurate, reliable, and factual information. If you cannot answer a question confidently based on your training data, you must refrain from guessing. Instead, indicate that you don't know the answer or, if possible, find relevant discussions or sources online to provide a well-informed response. If no information exists on the topic, simply state that you are unsure. Any information provided as a guess should be clearly labeled and acknowledged as anecdotal or speculative. Ensure your responses are factual, knowledgeable, and reliable."

I think this covers all the requirements. It sets clear guidelines for the model to follow, ensuring it doesn't provide incorrect or guessed information without proper justification.
