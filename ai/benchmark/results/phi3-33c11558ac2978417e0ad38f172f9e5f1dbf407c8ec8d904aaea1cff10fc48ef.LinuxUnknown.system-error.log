When looking for the best containerized environment on Proxmox that can run macOS and manage persistent workflows such as configuring software for 3D printing, you have several options based on available compatibility with Docker containers:

1. **Using WSL2** (if a recent enough version of Windows is installed): Although it's primarily designed to work well within the Linux environment that Proxmox operates under, there are ways to run macOS applications using WSL2 through virtualization technologies such as Parallels Desktop for Mac or Docker itself with compatibility layers like WineBottler. However, this might not be straightforward and requires significant technical knowledge of both systems' interoperability mechanisms.

    - It’s important to note that macOS applications typically rely on the graphical user interface (GUI) components which are native to macOS; hence running them within a container or even WSL2 may present challenges since they expect direct interaction with macOS hardware and system libraries, not just Unix-like interfaces.
    - If you decide to proceed, make sure your version of Windows is updated as some older versions might have compatibility issues due to changes in the underlying architecture (e.g., from x64 back to Itanium). Moreover, keep an eye on updates since Proxmox does not officially support running macOS containers natively yet there's a workaround with Parallels Desktop and WSL2 combination as of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023.

    Here are the steps to follow using this approach: (This is an advanced setup requiring expertise.)
    1. Install Windows on your Proxmox VM, making sure it’s a recent version like Server Core for compatibility reasons if needed. Download Parallels Desktop and install MacOS as guest software inside WSL2 or Docker with the `wine` installation (or compatible tools).
    ```bash
    1. Install macOS via Boot Camp Assistant on your physical machine, then clone it into a Proxmox VM using Parallels' export functionality to create an image file of Mac OS X that can be imported back into Parallels as guest software later if needed (this process is complex and not officially supported by either party).
    2. Within the Windows environment on your physical machine, install Docker with WSL 2 enabled via `nvdiaclink`. To make sure it works properly in a VM context: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-kernel#setup (requires an updated BIOS)
    3. Install Parallels Desktop for Windows and set up your Proxmox virtual machine to run as a guest under WSL 2 if not already using Docker directly, following their documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
    4. Install macOS in Parallels Desktop for Windows VM (this process is convoluted and may involve exporting a Mac OS X image). Alternatively install WineBottler within the Proxmox VM to run some of your preferred macOS applications via compatibility layers if they are available as binaries or scripts.
    5. Transfer data between systems for configuration files, which might be complex but possible using shared folders and SSH protocols provided by both Windows 10/Server Core (for the Proxmox VM) and Parallels Desktop with MacOS running on it separately via network path sharing if needed: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/share
    ```
    2. **Using Docker directly** within your preferred OS environment, macOS or Windows is the recommended approach as of early 2023 when using Proxmox for containerization needs due to its native support and ease of use. You can install Docker Desktop on a physical MacBook (if not already installed) since it doesn't natively run inside Linux containers: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/#macos
    ```bash
    1. Install the latest stable version of Docker for Windows using Docker Hub or direct download from Docker website, which should include WSL 2 support as part of its features if you’re running it on a recent Windows build with Hyper-V enabled: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#installation
    2. Install Proxmox Manager and connect to your environment (if not already connected). Ensure that both the VMs are using WSL 2 underneath by running `wsl --list` in Windows Terminal or Command Prompt, then check if they support it with a simple command such as:
        ```bash
        1. List available distributions and ensure you choose one compatible with macOS executables like BSD variants of Linux (if needed).
        2. Connect to your Proxmox environment via the graphical interface or CLI using ssh for secure communication between systems if necessary, enabling port forwarding as required: https://docs.proxmox.com/en-us/managers/howto#connecting-from-linux (this assumes you already have SSH set up on both macOS and Windows.)
    ```
3. **Using KVM** with nested virtualization technology if your host machine supports it, allowing for full Mac OS inside a VM: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/infrastructure-solutions/#virtualized-platforms (Note that this is not officially supported by Microsoft and requires specific hardware configurations).
    ```bash
    1. Check if your physical machine supports Intel VT or AMD-V, which are features required for nested virtualization to function: https://wiki.winehq.org/KVM#Support_for_Nested_Virtualisation (You may need third-party tools like VMware Tools as well).
    2. Install KVM on your Proxmox Server Core installation and ensure that the hardware acceleration feature is enabled for better performance: https://docs.proxmox.com/en-us/managers/kvm#installation (Requires installing additional kernels with specific modules).
    3. Follow KVM guides to create a VM in Proxmox that can run MacOS using its bootable image, and ensure your nested virtualization is set up correctly: https://wiki.winehq.org/KVM (This approach has limitations due to potential licensing issues with running macOS on non-Apple hardware).
    ```
In conclusion, while it's possible in theory using the WSL2 and Parallels Desktop or Docker methods for Mac OS X compatibility inside a Proxmox environment via containerization (or nested virtualization), these approaches are complex workarounds that may not be officially recommended due to potential licensing issues with macOS running on non-Apple hardware. The direct installation of Docker containers natively should provide the best and most stable experience, but keep in mind this might require a Windows host or VM alongside your Proxmox setup (with Mac OS X installed directly). As always, stay updated with official releases as these capabilities are subject to change over time due to ongoing developments by both Microsoft and third-party contributors.
