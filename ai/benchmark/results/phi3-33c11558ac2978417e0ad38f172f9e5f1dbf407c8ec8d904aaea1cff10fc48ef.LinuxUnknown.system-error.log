For your needs, considering both Mac and non-Mac operating systems (Linux/Windows), Proxmox offers KVM guests that can run full virtualization environments capable of running most macOS applications with Wine or Parallels Desktop for Windows emulation software installed within the guest. However, if you're specifically looking to centralize a workflow like 3D printing slicer configuration which might require real-time interaction and possibly some native Mac functionalities (like handling specific .stl files), directly using macOS would be preferable due to its optimized performance for these tasks on Apple hardware.

Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Install KVM Guest OSes with Proxmox Manager or CLI tools if necessary, ensuring they have enough resources (CPU, RAM) allocated based on your workflow'term requirements. Since macOS is not officially supported by default and requires emulation software to run within a VM environment like Vagrant/VirtualBox under the hood of KVM inside Proxmox, you can consider using Linux with Wine or Parallels Desktop for Windows as alternatives that provide similar levels of compatibility without Mac OS itself.

2. Install macOS in your guest (if possible) directly via Boot Camp Manager on a physical machine and connect it to the virtual environment through KVM-VNC, which allows real display output from within the VM. This setup can work well for tasks requiring heavy graphical processing but would not be ideal if you're looking solely into remote desktop solutions without syncing configurations between machines due to potential bandwidth limitations with continuous data transfer of high-resolution graphics files like 3D models and prints settings.

Alternatively, since macOS is a native operating system for Apple hardware:

1. Consider using Parallels Desktop or another Mac virtualization tool that runs directly on Proxmox KVM nodes (which can be done through compatibility layers such as QEMU). The advantage here would allow full access to the GUI without emulation, but this might not always work flawlessly due to hardware-specific optimizations in macOS.

2. With Parallels Desktop or similar software that supports Mac OS running inside VMs (like VirtualBox), you can use a shared folder feature for your 3D printing slicer configurations and models, allowing the guest system's configuration management without having to sync via network resources directly in real-time due to latency concerns.

If Parallels Desktop or similar software doesn’t allow Mac OS running on KVM nodes within Proxmox (as of my knowledge cutoff), you might want a Linux solution with Wine for macOS applications compatibility, which can run 3D printing slicers quite effectively as it does not natively support them but has significant progress in porting various software over the years.

Remember to ensure that your network setup between Proxmox and guest machines is optimized for handling potentially large files being transferred without sync issues or latency, which can disrupt workflow continuity – consider using SSH tunneling with compression (if bandwidth allows) as an intermediary layer rather than direct file transfers when possible.

Lastly, always keep in mind that performance and compatibility will vary based on the specific 3D printing slicer software you choose to run within your containerized environment, especially considering graphical processing demands which might not be natively optimized for virtualization environments without real hardware acceleration (like NVIDIA GPUs).
