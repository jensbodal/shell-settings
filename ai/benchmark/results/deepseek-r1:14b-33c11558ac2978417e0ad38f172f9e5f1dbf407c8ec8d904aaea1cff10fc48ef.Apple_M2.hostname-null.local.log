Okay, so I need to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to run on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. I prefer macOS but am open to Linux or Windows solutions as well. The main goal is to centralize the workflow in a local remote desktop setup to avoid syncing configurations across machines.

First, let me break down what each component means here. 

Proxmox is an open-source platform for managing virtualization and containers. So, I can run various OSes on it using virtual machines (VMs) or containers. Containers are lighter and more efficient than VMs because they share the host's kernel.

A remote desktop environment allows me to access a graphical interface from another machine. Since I want this to be containerized, I need something that can run within a container on Proxmox and provide a GUI that I can access remotely.

Persistent workflows mean that whatever work I do—like configuring 3D printing slicer settings—should persist even if the container restarts or the system goes down. So, data storage needs to be handled properly, probably by mounting host directories into the container so data isn't lost when the container stops.

I'm focusing on Proxmox as the host because it's efficient for such setups. Now, the remote desktop environments I know include VNC, RDP, and maybe Xfce or others. Since macOS is preferred, but Linux/Windows are acceptable alternatives, I need to see which of these can be containerized and run smoothly.

Let me think about possible options:

1. **Xfce in a Docker Container**: Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for Linux that's perfect for remote setups. If I use Proxmox with LXC containers, I could set up an Ubuntu or Debian-based container running Xfce. Then, I can access it via VNC.

2. **macOS in a VM with Remote Desktop**: Since macOS isn't really supported as a server OS and is typically only available on Apple hardware, this might not be feasible unless using something like VMware Fusion or Parallels on a Mac, but that's more for running Windows or Linux alongside macOS rather than virtualizing another instance.

3. **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**: But WSL isn't really a container and requires Windows as the host OS, which I don't have in Proxmox unless I'm using a VM with Windows.

4. **RDP Solutions**: There are RDP servers that can run in containers. For example, using something like FreeRDP or Remmina in a Docker container to expose an RDP service.

Wait, but macOS doesn't natively support running Windows-based remote desktop environments unless through specific software. So, perhaps sticking with Linux is more feasible for the containerized environment since it's more commonly used in such setups.

Looking back at VNC options: I've heard of solutions where you can run a VNC server inside a Docker container and expose its port so you can connect to it remotely. That might be a good approach because Xfce or another desktop environment can be lightweight enough for 3D printing workflows.

Another thought is using Proxmox's LXC containers, which are more lightweight than KVM VMs but still provide a full OS environment. So, setting up an Ubuntu container with Xfce and VNC server could work well.

I should also consider data persistence. Since the host directories on Proxmox can be mounted into the container, any configuration files or slicer settings would be stored there, ensuring they persist even if the container restarts.

Let me outline a possible setup:

- Host: Proxmox running on my local machine (or server).
- Inside Proxmox, create an LXC container with an Ubuntu or Debian distribution.
- Install Xfce as the desktop environment in the container.
- Set up a VNC server to allow remote access to the Xfce session.
- Mount necessary directories (like where slicer configs are stored) from the host into the container so they're persistent.

Now, I need to think about how to configure this. For Proxmox, creating an LXC container is straightforward via the web interface or command line. Then, installing the necessary software: Xfce for the desktop and a VNC server like TigerVNC or RealVNC.

I should also ensure that the container has access to the host's storage where I'll keep my 3D printing projects and slicer configurations. This way, any work done in the remote session is saved directly into those mounted directories.

Security-wise, I need to set up proper authentication for VNC so only authorized users can connect. Maybe using certificates or strong passwords.

Now, comparing this with other options: If I went with a Windows-based RDP solution, it might be overkill since the user prefers macOS but is open to alternatives. However, running Linux in an LXC container seems efficient and meets all the requirements.

I should also think about performance. 3D printing slicer configurations can sometimes be CPU-intensive, so ensuring that the host Proxmox system has enough resources allocated to the container (CPU, RAM) would be important for smooth operation.

In summary, using a Linux-based LXC container with Xfce and VNC server on Proxmox seems like the best approach. It allows for a remote desktop environment, centralizes workflows by persisting data through mounted host directories, and avoids unnecessary syncing between machines.

To address the need for a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent 3D printing workflows, the optimal solution is to use an LXC container running a lightweight Linux distribution with a VNC server. Here's a structured approach:

### Solution: Containerized Remote Desktop Using LXC and Xfce

1. **Host Setup**:
   - Use Proxmox as the host platform, leveraging its efficient virtualization capabilities.

2. **Container Configuration**:
   - Create an LXC container within Proxmox.
   - Choose a lightweight Linux distribution such as Ubuntu or Debian for the container to ensure efficiency and resource conservation.

3. **Desktop Environment**:
   - Install Xfce as the desktop environment in the container, providing a user-friendly interface suitable for remote work.

4. **Remote Access**:
   - Set up a VNC server (e.g., TigerVNC or RealVNC) within the container to enable remote graphical access.
   - Configure the VNC server to allow secure connections, using strong authentication methods to ensure security.

5. **Data Persistence**:
   - Mount necessary host directories into the container. These directories will store 3D printing projects and slicer configurations, ensuring data persistence even when the container restarts.

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Allocate sufficient resources (CPU, RAM) to the container based on the workload of 3D printing tasks to ensure smooth operation.

### Summary

This setup provides a centralized, efficient, and secure environment for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations. By using an LXC container with Xfce and VNC server on Proxmox, you achieve a remote desktop solution that avoids the need for syncing configurations across multiple machines, aligning with both technical requirements and user preferences.
