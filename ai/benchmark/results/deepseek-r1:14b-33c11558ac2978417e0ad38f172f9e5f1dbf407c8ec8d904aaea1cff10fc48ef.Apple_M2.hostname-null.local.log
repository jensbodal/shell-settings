Alright, I'm trying to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to set up on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. I prefer macOS but am open to Linux or Windows if needed.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. The user wants a remote desktop setup that runs in a container on Proxmox. The main goal is to centralize their workflow so they don't have to sync configurations between different machines. This makes sense because syncing can be error-prone and time-consuming.

Since the user prefers macOS, I should think about whether it's feasible to run a Mac environment inside a container on Proxmox. Wait, Proxmox is based on Debian, which is a Linux distribution. Running macOS in a container isn't straightforward because macOS isn't designed to run as a guest OS in containers or virtual machines like VMware or VirtualBox. So, maybe trying to run macOS within a Proxmox container won't work. I should check if there are any solutions for that.

Alternatively, the user is open to Linux or Windows, so perhaps focusing on those would be better. They want something persistent, which means the environment needs to retain data and configurations even after rebooting or stopping the container. So whatever solution I come up with must handle persistence properly.

Let me think about possible containers. Docker is the obvious choice since it's widely used. But in Proxmox, you can run both KVM virtual machines and Docker containers. The user wants a remote desktop, so maybe using Xfce or another lightweight Linux desktop environment inside a Docker container could work. Then they can access this via a remote desktop protocol (RDP) or VNC.

Wait, but if the container is based on Debian (since Proxmox is Debian-based), that's manageable. They could set up a Docker container with a Linux distro, install Xfce or another desktop, and configure it so that it can be accessed remotely. Then they can run their 3D printing software in this persistent environment.

Alternatively, maybe using a pre-built remote desktop Docker image would save time. There are images like remote-desktop/xrdp which allow you to set up RDP access quickly. That might simplify the setup process.

The user also mentioned that configurations should be persistent. In Docker, volumes can be used to mount host directories into the container, ensuring data isn't lost when the container restarts or is removed. So setting up proper volume mounts would be crucial here.

If I go the Windows route, using a Windows Server Core image with RDP enabled could work, but that's more resource-intensive and might not be as straightforward as Linux-based solutions. Plus, Windows licensing could complicate things if they're running it in a container.

So putting this together: the best approach would likely involve setting up a Docker container on Proxmox, using a lightweight Linux desktop environment, configuring remote access via RDP or VNC, and ensuring that necessary directories are mounted as volumes for persistence. This way, all their workflow configurations stay in one place, avoiding the need to sync across machines.

I should outline the steps they'd need to take: installing Docker on Proxmox (though I think Proxmox already has Docker integrated?), setting up a container with Xfce or similar, enabling remote desktop services, and mapping necessary ports. They'll also need to set up volumes for their workflow data to persist across container restarts.

Additionally, they might want to consider how to access this RDP session—whether through the host machine's display or via network-accessible RDP. Security is another consideration; they should ensure that remote desktop access is secured, especially if accessing over the internet.

In summary, the solution would involve a Linux-based Docker container with a lightweight desktop environment, configured for remote access and persistence, providing a centralized workspace for their 3D printing and other workflows.

To set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, follow these organized steps:

### Solution Overview:
- **Containerization:** Use Docker to create a lightweight, isolated environment.
- **Desktop Environment:** Choose a Linux-based desktop (e.g., Xfce) due to compatibility and ease of setup.
- **Remote Access:** Enable remote desktop protocols like RDP or VNC for access.
- **Persistence:** Use Docker volumes to ensure data persists across container restarts.

### Step-by-Step Setup:

1. **Access Proxmox Host:**
   - Connect to your Proxmox host via SSH or directly if possible.

2. **Install Docker (if not already installed):**
   - Run `sudo apt install docker.io` and start the service with `sudo systemctl start docker`.

3. **Pull a Remote Desktop Base Image:**
   - Use a pre-built image like `remote-desktop/xrdp` for quick setup.
     ```bash
     sudo docker pull remote/remote-desktop:xrdp
     ```

4. **Run the Docker Container:**
   - Start the container and map necessary ports (e.g., 3389 for RDP, 5900-5902 for VNC).
     ```bash
     sudo docker run -d --name rdp-container \
       -p 3389:3389 -p 5900-5902:5900-5902 \
       remote/remote-desktop:xrdp
     ```

5. **Set Up Remote Desktop Access:**
   - Use an RDP client (e.g., Remmina, AnyDesk) to connect to the host's IP on port 3389 or VNC clients on ports 5900-5902.

6. **Install Necessary Software:**
   - Once inside the container, install software like Cura for 3D printing.
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install cura
     ```

7. **Configure Persistence with Volumes:**
   - Mount host directories into the container to save workflow data.
     ```bash
     sudo docker run -d --name rdp-container \
       -v /host/path:/container/path \
       -p 3389:3389 -p 5900-5902:5900-5902 \
       remote/remote-desktop:xrdp
     ```

8. **Enable Auto-Login (Optional):**
   - Modify the RDP configuration to allow auto-login for easier access.

### Considerations:
- **Performance:** Ensure adequate resources (CPU, RAM) are allocated for smooth operation.
- **Security:** Secure RDP access with strong passwords and consider SSH tunneling for remote connections.
- **Licensing:** If using Windows-based containers, ensure proper licensing compliance.

This setup provides a centralized, persistent environment for your workflows, accessible remotely from any machine.
