Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. My preference is macOS, but I'm open to Linux or Windows if needed.

First, I need to understand what exactly I'm looking for. I want a remote desktop setup that runs in a container because containers are lightweight and portable. This will allow me to centralize my workflow on Proxmox so I don't have to sync configurations between different machines. That sounds efficient and saves time on managing settings across devices.

Since I prefer macOS, I wonder if there are any macOS-based remote desktop solutions that work well with containerization. Docker is the most common containerization tool, but does it support macOS natively? I recall that Docker Desktop runs on macOS, but can it host a macOS environment as a container? Or do I need something else?

Wait, actually, Docker doesn't directly support macOS as a guest OS in containers. Containers typically run as lightweight VMs with the same OS as the host. So if my Proxmox host is Linux-based, maybe using a Linux-based container would be more straightforward, but perhaps there's a way to run Windows or macOS through some other means.

I know that Proxmox is based on Debian and uses KVM for virtualization. Containers in Proxmox are actually lightweight KVM VMs with shared resources. So they're not the same as Docker containers, which are more resource-efficient but rely on the host's kernel. Maybe I'm confusing terms here—Proxmox refers to them as "containers" but they are technically full-fledged VMs.

So, if I want a remote desktop that can run macOS or Windows, maybe using a Proxmox container (which is a KVM VM) would be the way to go. That way, I can install macOS or Windows on the VM and then access it remotely via VNC or another protocol.

But wait, the user mentioned wanting a containerized environment. If Docker containers don't support macOS natively, perhaps I should look into using a Linux-based container with X11 forwarding for GUI applications. That way, I can run Linux tools like Blender or Cura within a Docker container and have them display on my macOS machine via remote desktop.

Alternatively, maybe there's a tool that allows running Windows containers in Proxmox? Or perhaps using something like Vagrant to manage the VMs alongside Docker Compose for services. That might complicate things, though.

I'm also thinking about persistence. Since I want persistent workflows, the container or VM should retain data between sessions. If it's a Docker container, I can map host directories into the container so that any changes are saved outside the container's file system, ensuring persistence even if the container restarts.

Another thought: remote desktop software like AnyDesk or TeamViewer could be used to access the Proxmox VM from my macOS machine. But does that offer the portability and ease of management I'm looking for? Maybe not as much as a built-in VNC solution.

I should consider which remote desktop protocol is best. VNC is common but might have performance issues over slower connections. SPICE is another option, often used with Virt-manager and Proxmox, and it supports features like clipboard sharing and drag-and-drop, which could be beneficial for workflow management.

Also, I need to think about how to integrate this into my existing setup. If I'm using macOS as the primary machine, connecting to a remote desktop session running in a container or VM on Proxmox should let me manage all my 3D printing configurations and other workflows without needing to sync files between devices.

So, putting it together: perhaps set up a Linux-based Docker container with necessary software for 3D printing tools, map the relevant directories to ensure persistence, and then access that via remote desktop. Alternatively, create a Proxmox VM (container) running macOS or Windows, configure remote access, and manage workflows from there.

I'm a bit confused about whether I should go the Docker route with Linux containers or use a full VM for macOS/Windows. Each has its pros and cons in terms of resource usage and ease of setup.

In summary, my options seem to be:
1. Use Proxmox containers (KVM VMs) running macOS or Windows, set up remote desktop access via VNC/SPICE.
2. Use Docker containers on a Linux host within Proxmox, forwarding GUI apps over X11 or another protocol.
3. Combine both approaches using tools like Vagrant and Docker Compose for orchestration.

I think the first option might be simpler for me since I want macOS as the preferred OS, but if that's not feasible, going with a Linux container setup could still work by providing access to necessary GUI applications via remote desktop.

To set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, considering your preference for macOS but openness to other OS, here is a structured approach:

### Approach:
1. **Proxmox Containers (KVM VMs):**
   - **Option 1: macOS or Windows VM**
     - Set up a Proxmox container as a KVM VM running macOS or Windows.
     - Configure remote desktop access using VNC or SPICE protocol for efficient interaction.
     - Ensure data persistence by mounting host directories within the VM.

2. **Docker Containers with Remote Desktop Access:**
   - If macOS isn't feasible in a container, use a Linux-based Docker container on a Proxmox node.
   - Install necessary 3D printing tools and map directories to persist data.
   - Use X11 forwarding or remote desktop software (e.g., Remmina) to access the GUI applications from your macOS machine.

3. **Hybrid Approach with Vagrant and Docker Compose:**
   - For orchestration, use Vagrant to manage VMs and Docker Compose for services.
   - This integrates well with Proxmox and provides a managed environment for workflows.

### Recommendation:
- **Preferred Method:** Use a Proxmox container (KVM VM) running macOS or Windows. Configure remote desktop access via SPICE for better performance features like clipboard sharing. Mount necessary directories to ensure persistence of your 3D printing configurations.

This setup centralizes your workflow on Proxmox, avoiding the need to sync configurations across multiple machines and providing a seamless experience from your macOS device.
