Okay, the user wants to set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox to manage persistent workflows, specifically for 3D printing slicer configuration. They prefer macOS but are open to Linux or Windows. The main goal is to avoid syncing configs between machines by centralizing everything locally.

First, I need to figure out what containerized remote desktop options are available. Proxmox supports LXC and KVM. Since they mentioned containerized, probably LXC is the way to go. But wait, remote desktop environments usually require a graphical interface. So maybe they want a container that runs a desktop environment, which can be accessed remotely.

Let me think about the options. There's LXC containers that can run a full OS, like a minimal Linux distro with a desktop environment. Then, they can use VNC or RDP to access it. But setting up a container with a desktop might be resource-heavy. Alternatively, maybe using a lightweight container with a specific desktop environment.

The user prefers macOS, but macOS is not typically run in containers. Apple's ecosystem doesn't support containerization for macOS in the same way Linux does. So maybe they're considering a macOS VM? But the question says containerized. Hmm. Maybe they're okay with a macOS VM but want it containerized? Wait, Proxmox can run KVM VMs, but containers are LXC. So if they need macOS, they might have to use a KVM VM, but that's not a container. The user might be confused here. Alternatively, maybe they're looking for a macOS container, but that's not feasible with standard LXC. So perhaps they're open to Linux or Windows containers, and macOS is a preference but not a strict requirement.

So maybe they can use a Linux container with a desktop environment, or a Windows container if they need Windows. But Windows containers are more limited in terms of GUI support. Alternatively, using a lightweight Linux container with a desktop.

Another angle: the user wants persistent workflows, so the container needs to retain configurations. So maybe using a container that runs a desktop environment like X11, and then access it via VNC or something. Or maybe using a remote desktop server like Xrdp or TigerVNC.

Wait, maybe the user is looking for a container that acts as a remote desktop server. For example, running a Windows or macOS VM inside Proxmox, but that's not a container. Alternatively, using a container with a desktop environment and then using a remote desktop protocol to access it.

Let me think about the options. For macOS, the only way is a VM, but that's not a container. So maybe the user is okay with a Linux or Windows container. For 3D printing slicers, common ones are Cura (which is Windows-based), Slic3r (cross-platform), and others. So maybe they need a Windows environment for some slicers, or Linux for others.

If they go with a Linux container, they could install a desktop environment like XFCE or LXDE, which are lightweight. Then, set up a VNC server inside the container so they can access it remotely. Alternatively, using X11 forwarding with SSH, but that might be less user-friendly.

Another possibility is using a container with a remote desktop server like xrdp or vinagre. For example, a Linux container with XFCE and xrdp, then access it via RDP. That could be a good option.

Alternatively, using a Windows container. Wait, Windows containers are different. They can run Windows applications, but the GUI might be more complex. Also, Windows containers are more limited in terms of GUI support compared to Linux containers. But if they need Windows-specific tools, maybe that's necessary.

But since the user mentioned avoiding syncing configurations between machines, centralizing the workflow in a local remote desktop, they probably want a single instance that they can access from any machine. So the container needs to be persistent, so that when they log in, all their configurations are there.

So possible solutions:

1. Use a Linux container with a desktop environment (XFCE, LXDE) and VNC or RDP access. This would be a good option for lightweight, persistent workflows.

2. Use a Windows container, but I'm not sure if Windows containers support GUI apps in a way that's accessible via RDP. Maybe using a VM for Windows is better, but that's not a container.

3. For macOS, since it's not containerizable, maybe they can use a macOS VM (KVM) and then access it via VNC or RDP. But that's not a container.

So the best options are probably Linux containers with a desktop environment and remote access, or a Windows VM. But the user said containerized, so maybe focusing on Linux.

Another point: Proxmox's LXC containers can have a graphical interface if they have the necessary packages. So creating an LXC container with a minimal Linux distro, installing a desktop environment, and then setting up a VNC server or RDP server.

For example, using Ubuntu as the base, installing XFCE, and then running a VNC server. Then, they can access it via a VNC client. Alternatively, using xrdp to access it via RDP, which might be more user-friendly.

But setting up a VNC server in a container might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, using a container that runs a remote desktop service. There's also the possibility of using a tool like NoVNC or similar, but that's more for web-based access.

Another thought: maybe using a container that runs a remote desktop server, like a Windows server container, but again, not sure about GUI support.

Alternatively, using a container that runs a desktop environment and then using a remote desktop protocol. For example, a container with Ubuntu and XFCE, then xrdp installed, so that you can RDP into it.

But how to set that up in Proxmox? Let me think. The steps would be:

- Create an LXC container with a Linux distro (Ubuntu maybe).
- Install the necessary desktop environment (XFCE, maybe).
- Install xrdp or a VNC server.
- Configure the container to allow remote access.
- Then, connect via RDP or VNC client.

This would allow the user to have a persistent environment where they can configure their 3D slicer, and all settings are stored in the container.

For macOS, if they really need it, maybe using a macOS VM with Proxmox's KVM, but that's not a container. However, if they're okay with a VM, that's an option, but the question says containerized.

So the answer would likely be to use a Linux container with a desktop environment and remote access, either via VNC or RDP. For macOS, it's not feasible in a container, so maybe they need to use a VM, but the user might prefer Linux.

Another consideration: the 3D printing slicers. For example, Cura is Windows-based, but there are Linux versions. So if they can run the slicer on Linux, that's better. Alternatively, they might need to run Windows for certain tools.

If they choose Linux, then the container approach is better. If they need Windows, maybe using a Windows container is possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, a Windows VM.

But the user said "containerized", so maybe they want a container. However, Windows containers are more limited. Maybe they can use a Windows container with a GUI, but that's not straightforward.

In conclusion, the best options are:

1. Use a Linux container with a desktop environment (like XFCE) and remote access via RDP or VNC. This is containerized, avoids syncing, and allows persistent workflows.

2. If they need macOS, use a macOS VM (KVM) with remote access, but that's not containerized.

So the answer would recommend the Linux container approach, as it's containerized and meets the requirements. Also, mention that macOS can't be done in a container, so a VM is the alternative.

Additionally, maybe consider using a container with a specific tool like a 3D slicer, but that's more likely to be a single application. However, the user wants a full desktop environment for configuring slicers, so a full desktop is needed.

Another point: persistent storage. The container needs to have persistent storage for the slicer configurations. So the container's root filesystem should be persistent, which in Proxmox LXC is handled by the container's configuration.

So the final recommendation would be to set up an LXC container with a Linux distro, install a desktop environment, and set up remote access. For macOS, a VM is necessary.

To achieve a **containerized remote desktop environment** on **Proxmox** for managing persistent workflows like **3D printing slicer configuration**, here's a structured approach:

---

### **Best Option: Linux Container with Desktop Environment**
**Why?**  
- **Containerized** (LXC) for lightweight, persistent, and isolated environments.  
- **Cross-platform** (Linux/Windows) support for slicer tools (e.g., Cura, Slic3r).  
- **No syncing** between machines, as configurations are centralized in the container.  

---

### **Step-by-Step Setup**

#### **1. Choose a Linux Distribution**
- **Ubuntu** or **Debian** are ideal for lightweight desktop environments.  
- Use a minimal base image to reduce resource usage.

#### **2. Create an LXC Container**
- In Proxmox, create a new **LXC container** with a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).  
- Ensure the container has **persistent storage** (e.g., a local volume or a ZFS dataset).

#### **3. Install a Lightweight Desktop Environment**
- **XFCE** or **LXDE** are recommended for low resource usage.  
  ```bash
  apt update && apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies xorg xserver-xorg
  ```
- Alternatively, use **GNOME** or **KDE** for a more feature-rich GUI (higher resource usage).

#### **4. Set Up Remote Access**
- **Option A: VNC Server**  
  Install **TigerVNC** or **x11vnc** for remote access.  
  ```bash
  apt install tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-xserver
  ```
  - Start the VNC server and configure it to run on boot.  
  - Access via a VNC client (e.g., RealVNC, TightVNC).

- **Option B: RDP Server (xrdp)**  
  Install **xrdp** for Windows-like RDP access.  
  ```bash
  apt install xrdp
  systemctl enable xrdp --now
  ```
  - Connect using an RDP client (e.g., Microsoft Remote Desktop, Remmina).

#### **5. Persistent Workflows**
- Store slicer configurations (e.g., Cura profiles, Slic3r settings) in the container's file system.  
- Ensure the container's root filesystem is persistent (e.g., using a volume or snapshot).

#### **6. Access from Any Machine**
- Use the container's IP address and the chosen remote protocol (VNC/RDP) to access the desktop.  
- All workflows (e.g., slicer configuration) are saved in the container, avoiding manual syncing.

---

### **macOS Considerations**
- **Not feasible in a container**: macOS cannot be run as a container in Proxmox (LXC/KVM).  
- **Alternative**: Use a **KVM VM** with macOS (e.g., using a macOS virtual machine image).  
  - Requires a macOS license and Apple's hypervisor support (not fully supported in Proxmox).  
  - Access via VNC or RDP if configured.

---

### **Windows Option (if needed)**
- **Windows containers** are not ideal for GUI workflows.  
- **Alternative**: Use a **KVM VM** with Windows (e.g., Windows 10/11) for tools like Cura.  
  - Install RDP services (e.g., **xrdp** or **Remote Desktop Services**) for remote access.  
  - This is less containerized but more compatible with Windows-specific tools.

---

### **Summary**
- **Best for Linux/Windows workflows**: Use an **LXC container** with **XFCE** or **xrdp** for remote access.  
- **macOS**: Use a **KVM VM** (not containerized) if required.  
- **Persistent Configurations**: Store all slicer settings in the container's file system.  

This setup ensures centralized, persistent workflows without syncing across machines.
