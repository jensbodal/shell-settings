 To achieve your goal of creating a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that supports macOS, Linux, and Windows, I would recommend using a combination of Docker containers for the specific applications (like 3D printing slicers) and a Remote Desktop Server (RDS) container for managing the graphical user interface.

   Here's an outline to guide you through setting up this environment:

1. Install Docker on your Proxmox server if it isn't already installed. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install docker.io -y
```

2. Create a network for your containers, so they can communicate easily:

```bash
docker network create rdp-network
```

3. Pull the RDS container image of your choice (e.g., Microsoft Remote Desktop Server, XRDP). For this example, I'll use XRDP:

```bash
docker pull xrdp/xrdp
```

4. Create a Docker volume to store the RDS configuration and data:

```bash
docker volume create rdp-data
```

5. Run the XRDP container using your preferred OS, setting environment variables, and attaching the volume and network:

```bash
docker run -it --name rdp -v rdp-data:/etc/xrdp -e XORG_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/xrdp/xstartorg.sh -e USER=<your-user> -e PASSWORD=<your-password> -p 3389:3389 --net rdp-network xrdp
```

   Replace `<your-user>` and `<your-password>` with a valid user and password for the RDS server.

6. Install the Docker client on the machine you'll be using to connect to the remote desktop, so you can easily access it. You can do this by downloading the appropriate package from the Docker website (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and installing it according to your operating system.

7. Pull the desired 3D printing slicer container image, create a new network for communication between containers, and run the container using the same network as the RDS server:

```bash
docker pull <slicer-image>
docker network create slicer-network
docker run -it --name slicer -v slicer-data:/mnt/data --net slicer-network <slicer-image>
```

8. Connect to the RDS server using your preferred RDP client, and you'll be able to access the 3D printing slicer container from there. Any changes made within the container will remain persistent without needing to sync configurations between machines.
