Fresh and Juicy

**Translation and Conversation:**

Person A (English): "I found a great deal on fresh apples today. They're really juicy."

Person B (Norwegian): "69F? That's quite hot in here!"

Person A: "No, no! It's the temperature at which I stored the apples."

Person B: "Ah, jeg forstod feil (I misunderstood). The apples sound delicious."

**Narrative:**

As Person A enters the room with a basket of fresh, red apples, they place them on the wooden table. Person B notices the heat and expresses concern, misunderstanding it as a reference to the room temperature. After clarification, Person B is delighted to hear about the juicy apples.

In Norwegian:
- "69F" = "69 grader Fahrenheit"
- "It's quite hot in here!" = "Det er veldig varmt her!"
- "I misunderstood." = "Jeg forstod feil."
- "The apples sound delicious." = "Æpplene lydes utrolig godt."
