⠙ Okay, this is a really solid use case for containerized remote desktop environments, and your goal of centralizing workflows is smart. Let's break down the best options for running a persistent 3D printing workflow on Proxmox, considering your preferences and needs.

Here’s a breakdown of the top contenders, categorized with their strengths and weaknesses, specifically tailored to your persistent workflow scenario:

**1. VNC with Docker & Portainer (Highly Recommended – Flexible & Mature)**

* **How it Works:** You'll essentially run a VNC server (like TightVNC or RealVNC) *inside* a Docker container.  Portainer simplifies managing the container and the VNC server.
* **Pros:**
    * **Flexibility:**  Works equally well with macOS, Linux, and Windows. You can install your 3D printer slicing software (PrusaSlicer, Cura, etc.) directly into the container.
    * **Persistence:**  The container persists its files and configurations.  Changes made within the VNC session *will* be saved.
    * **Mature & Stable:** VNC and Docker are incredibly well-established technologies.
    * **Low Overhead:** Docker containers are lightweight.
    * **Portainer Integration:** Portainer provides a fantastic web-based interface for managing your containers, networking, storage, and overall Proxmox environment.
    * **Cost:** VNC servers are free and open-source.
* **Cons:**
    * **Slightly More Complex Setup:**  You’ll need to learn basic Docker and Portainer concepts.
    * **Performance:**  VNC performance can sometimes be a bottleneck, especially over slower networks.  Optimizing the VNC server settings is crucial.
* **Example Docker Compose File (Illustrative):**

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  vnc:
    image: vasilievvv/tightvnc
    ports:
      - "5900:5900"  #VNC Port
    shm_size: 1024M #Increase if needed for slicing
    volumes:
      - vnc_data:/home/vnc/.vnc
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  vnc_data:
```

**2. Remmina with Docker (Good Alternative - Excellent Client Features)**

* **How it Works:** Remmina is a popular and powerful remote desktop client. You run a VNC server inside a Docker container and connect to it using Remmina.
* **Pros:**
    * **User-Friendly Remmina Client:** Remmina is known for its excellent features, including session management, multiple protocol support, and customization.
    * **Docker Integration:** Works seamlessly with Docker.
* **Cons:**
    *  Similar VNC performance considerations as above.

**3. Deep Freeze with Docker (Good for Offline Work/Snapshots)**

* **How it Works:**  Deep Freeze is a desktop virtualization solution that creates a snapshot of your session. It's ideal if you want to avoid constant changes to the base image and quickly revert to a known good state. This is great if you need to experiment with slicing settings and want to easily recover.
* **Pros:**
    * **Snapshot-Based Persistence:**  The container’s state is saved with each session, allowing for very quick rollbacks.
    * **Isolation:** Excellent for protecting your 3D printer configuration.
* **Cons:**
    * **Higher Overhead:**  Deep Freeze requires more resources than a simple VNC container.
    * **More Complex to Manage:** Requires understanding Deep Freeze's snapshotting mechanisms.

**4.  XFCE or LXDE Container + VNC (More Involved - Good if you like Linux Desktop)**

* **How it Works:** You create a full Linux desktop environment (XFCE or LXDE) inside a Docker container and then run a VNC server.
* **Pros:**
    * **Complete Desktop Environment:**  Feels most like a traditional desktop.
* **Cons:**
    * **Highest Overhead:** This is the most resource-intensive option.
    * **More Complex Setup:**  Requires more Linux knowledge.



**Recommendations & Prioritization**

1. **VNC with Docker & Portainer (Highly Recommended):**  This strikes the best balance of flexibility, persistence, and ease of management. It’s the most practical choice for your needs.
2. **Deep Freeze with Docker:**  If your primary concern is preventing configuration drift and rapid rollback is crucial, Deep Freeze is worth considering.
3. **Remmina with Docker:** If you want a top-tier remote desktop client and are comfortable with Remmina.

**Key Considerations for Your Workflow**

* **Network Speed:** Ensure you have a fast and stable network connection. VNC performance can be significantly affected by network latency.
* **3D Slicer/Software Choice:**  Confirm that the slicing software you choose has good support for remote access and running inside a container.
* **Storage:** How will you store your slicing configurations?  Use Docker volumes to persist data.
* **Security:**  Use strong passwords for your VNC server and secure your Proxmox environment.

To help me refine my recommendation further, could you tell me:

*   What 3D printing slicer software are you primarily using (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura, etc.)?
*   What is your approximate network speed (upload and download)?
*   What is your level of experience with Docker, VNC, and Linux?
