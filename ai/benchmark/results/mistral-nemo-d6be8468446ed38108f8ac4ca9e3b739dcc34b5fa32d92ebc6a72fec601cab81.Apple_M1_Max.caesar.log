As you're admiring the photo, you remember needing to write some code in Norwegian (using C language). You decide to translate the number 69F from English to Norwegian.

**You:** "How do I say 69F in Norwegian?"

**Assistant:** "In Norwegian, 'F' is often used to denote 'Farhenheit'. So, you would say '69 Fahrenheit' as '69 Fahrenheit' in Norwegian. There's no need to translate the number or the unit itself."

**You:** "So, it remains the same? 69F?"

**Assistant:** "Exactly! In this case, the English and Norwegian notations for temperature are identical."

**Conversation:**
- You: How do I say 69F in Norwegian?
- Assistant: 69 Fahrenheit
- You: So, it remains the same?
- Assistant: Yes, no translation needed.
