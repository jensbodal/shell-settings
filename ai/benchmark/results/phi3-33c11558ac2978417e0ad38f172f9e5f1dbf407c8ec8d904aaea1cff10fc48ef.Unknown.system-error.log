Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment) can be set up as a robust and versatile containerized solution for running different operating systems, including macOS through Parallels or VirtualBox, which are capable of virtualization with Mac's High Sierra XNU kernel compatibility on Linux. Here is how you could achieve this setup:

1. **Install Proxmox** - Start by installing the latest stable version of Proxmox VE (if not already installed). You can download it from [here](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads) and follow their installation instructions for your system, which includes setting up a control panel with web accessibility via `http` or `https`.

2. **Install Virtualization Software** - Since Parallels is Mac-specific but we need to run macOS on Linux (through virtual machines), it’s more practical to use open-source software like XenServer for this purpose:
   a. Download and install the latest version of Proxmox VE Server from [here](https://wwwspoolman.proxmox.com/download). After installation, you'll need Supermini as well if your host doesn’t have it installed by default; for that download OpenMINED (http://openmindedclouds.org/) and follow the instructions to install Miniconda3 on Proxmox Server VM with `Supermini` enabled:
   b. If using VirtualBox, ensure you've added Oracle as a trusted source in your virtual machine settings for macOS compatibility (https://www.virtualbox.com/manual/ch09.html).
   
3. **Create Mac OS VM** - Create and start new VM with the following steps:
   ```bash
   proxmox hostlist | grep "macvm" && echo "MacVM already running, skipping." || vboxmanage createvm --name macos --ostype Ubuntu20_64 --uart serial console 1 --nic bridge=br0 --monitor none
   ```
    This command creates a new VM with the name 'macos' and installs an Ubuntu guest system that emulates MacOS using virtualization software. You can then proceed to download macOS (https://www.macdownloader.com/) or use your existing Mojave/Catalina installation on external media, such as USB drives:
    ```bash
    sudo dd if=/path_to_installation.iso of=/dev/sdXY bs=4M status=none sync warn truncate 2>&1 | more # Replace /path_to_installation.iso with actual ISO path and sdXY with the correct device identifier for your setup (e.g., `/dev/sde` or similar)
    ```
   After installation, make sure to mount a filesystem inside macOS VM using Proxmox CLI:
   ```bash
   vboxmanage internalcommands createrawhd --output /media/user-data/macos hdd01 | qemu-nbd -o none & # Replace 'hdd01' with your MacVM name and '/dev/' to the actual device path as necessary. Also, replace `/media/` folder if needed using a shared network drive instead of local mounts within Proxmox VE settings for data persistence across VM lifecycle:
   ```bash
    proxmox web panel > ~/macos_mounted # This command will store the macOS mounted path in `~/macos_mounted` file on your host system. Be sure to replace this with a proper shared network drive or external storage device for persistence across VM lifecycles and reboots if needed.
    ```bash 
4. **Set up Remote Desktop** - Install the preferred remote desktop software, either Parallels Tools (for Mac OS), Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) clients like Microsoft's built-in RDP client for Windows or a compatible alternative on Linux such as [Remmina](https://remmina.org/), to access your macOS VM remotely:
   ```bash 
    vboxmanage guestproperty add "Parallels Tools Installation" --type String --value "/Applications/Parallels Toolbar.app" # This will install Parallels tools into the MacVM, allowing it to be managed via Remmina or similar clients on your host machine for remote access (for Linux this is not possible without additional setup like SSH tunneling).
   ```bash 
5. **Centralize Workflow Management** - To centralize workflow management and avoid syncing configurations between machines, you can:
    a. Use shared directories within Proxmox VE for persistent data storage that both the host OS and macOS VMs access (e.g., via SSH or network shares). This allows changes in settings to be reflected on all systems accessing these folders without needing them directly synced between different machines, just updated from one central point if needed.
    b. Utilize scripting within Proxmox CLI and bash scripts for common workflow tasks like slicer configuration updates or restarts which can also minimize the chances of having to sync configurations manually across systems (e.g., `vboxmanage guestproperty set "Slicer_Path" "/usr/local/bin"` on macOS VM).
    c. For 3D printing slicers and similar workflows, ensure your environment has all the dependencies required by both operating systems installed via Proxmox's package manager or through community-supported tools like Miniconda for Python packages (pip install <dependency>): `/usr/local/bin/` on macOS VM after installation.
    d. Utilize continuous integration and deployment methods to automate the testing process within a controlled environment that is accessed remotely, which minimizes human intervention in syncing configurations across machines manually for consistent workflows like 3D slicer configuration management (e.g., using Jenkins with Proxmox VE).
    e. Use dedicated shared network drives or cloud storage services to store the actual project files and share them between environments, which can also act as a backup solution if synchronization isn't needed for individual machine configurations but rather ongoing workflow across all machines within your networked environment using SSH keys or credentials stored securely (e.g., `ssh-keygen -A` followed by adding public key to authorized_keys in the `.ssh` directory).
    f. Lastly, employ Proxmox's built-in monitoring and management tools for health checks of your VM(s), ensuring that any critical updates or restarts needed do not disrupt workflow continuity across all machines using automated scripts (if necessary) based on thresholds set in the system configurations.
