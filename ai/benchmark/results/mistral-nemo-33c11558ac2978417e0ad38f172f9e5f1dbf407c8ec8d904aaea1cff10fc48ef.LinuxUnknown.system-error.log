â ™ To achieve your goal of running a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, you can use one of the following solutions. I've listed macOS-first options and then alternatives that support Linux or Windows:

1. **macOS (preferred) - Apple Remote Desktop (ARD)**:
   While not containerized, ARD is a powerful remote desktop solution for macOS users. It allows you to remotely manage your Macs, share desktops, and even control other users' screens. To use it with Proxmox:

   - Install ARD on the Mac guest running inside a Proxmox VM.
   - Enable Screen Sharing (Remote Management) on your Mac guests.
   - Configure ARD to connect to your Mac guests using their IP addresses or hostnames.

2. **macOS & Linux - NoMachine**:
   NoMachine is a free, cross-platform remote desktop application that uses NX technology for better performance and bandwidth optimization. It supports macOS and Linux. To use it with Proxmox:

   - Install NoMachine on both the Mac/Linux guest VMs and your host machine (running Proxmox).
   - Configure NoMachine to allow connections from specific IP addresses or by creating an account for your host machine.
   - Connect to your guests using the NoMachine client on your host machine.

3. **Linux & Windows - X2Go**:
   X2Go is another free, open-source remote desktop solution that supports Linux and Windows. It's lightweight and uses SSH for secure communication. To use it with Proxmox:

   - Install X2Go server on your Linux/Windows guest VMs.
   - Install X2Go client on your host machine (running Proxmox).
   - Configure X2Go to allow connections from your host machine's IP address.

4. **Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows) - VirtualGL**:
   VirtualGL is an open-source tool that allows you to access remote desktop services using OpenGL for hardware-accelerated 3D applications. It supports macOS, Linux, and Windows. To use it with Proxmox:

   - Install VirtualGL on both your guest VMs and the host machine running Proxmox.
   - Configure VirtualGL to allow connections from your host machine's IP address.
   - Connect to your guests using a remote desktop client that supports VirtualGL, such as TigerVNC or NoMachine.

For all these solutions, you can use containerization by installing them inside Docker containers. However, keep in mind that running a graphical user interface (GUI) application like a remote desktop client might require additional configuration for exposing the necessary ports and handling display settings.

Additionally, to maintain persistent workflows and configurations, consider using tools like version control systems (e.g., Git), synchronization services (e.g., Dropbox or Nextcloud), or container orchestration platforms (e.g., Docker Compose) to manage your files and settings.
