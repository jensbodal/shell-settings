Now, let's incorporate the famous equation, e=mc², into our narrative:

As you bite into this 'Fresh and Juicy' apple, you release energy (e) in the form of delightful flavors. In accordance with Einstein's famous theory, mass (m) - which includes the apple's matter - times the speed of light (c²), equals the energy released with each satisfying crunch. A truly enlightening snack!
