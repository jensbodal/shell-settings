⠙ ⠙ ⠸ ⠸ ⠴ ⠦  To achieve your goal of creating a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that supports macOS, Linux, and Windows for persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, I would suggest using Portainer and Docker to set up the desired containers. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your Proxmox VE server. You can find the installation instructions here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/proxmox_ve/

2. Install Portainer on Proxmox, which will provide a user-friendly web interface to manage your Docker containers and networks. Follow this guide to install it: https://portainer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/installation/proxmoxve/

3. Create a new network in Proxmox for your remote desktop container:
   - Log into the web interface of your Proxmox VE server
   - Go to Network > LAN > Configure IPv4 networks > Add New
     - Set the Subnet to something like 172.18.0.0/16 (make sure it doesn't conflict with any other subnets you may have)
     - Set the Gateway, Netmask, and DNS as appropriate for your network
   - Create a new VLAN if needed, or use an existing one that matches the network above

4. In your preferred terminal, navigate to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file will be created:

   ```
   mkdir ~/remote-desktop
   cd ~/remote-desktop
   ```

5. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content, adjusting as needed to support your specific use case and preferences:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  remote-desktop:
    image: jesseduffield/remote-it:latest # Choose the desired Remote Desktop server image (e.g., JumpCloud Connect, Microsoft RDP, VNC)
    restart: always
    environment:
      - TZ=America/Los_Angeles # Set your desired timezone
      - RDP_USERNAME=yourusername
      - RDP_PASSWORD=yourpassword
      - RDP_SERVER_IP=172.18.0.1 # The IP address of the container on your custom network (you can set this dynamically using DNS or a service like dnsmasq)
    ports:
      - 3389:3389 # Map the RDP port from the container to your host machine
    networks:
      - remote-desktop-network # The network created in step 3

  macos:
    image: docker.io/docker-library/macos
    build:
      context: ./macos-build
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /path/to/local/data/macos-persistent:/Users/Shared # Map a local folder to the shared folder inside the MacOS container for persistent data storage
    depends_on:
      - remote-desktop
    networks:
      - remote-desktop-network

  linux:
    image: docker.io/your_linux_image
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /path/to/local/data/linux:/home/username # Map a local folder to the home directory inside the Linux container for persistent data storage
    depends_on:
      - remote-desktop
    networks:
      - remote-desktop-network

  windows:
    image: docker.io/your_windows_image
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /path/to/local/data/windows:c:\Users\Public # Map a local folder to the Public folder inside the Windows container for persistent data storage
    depends_on:
      - remote-desktop
    networks:
      - remote-desktop-network

networks:
  remote-desktop-network:
    driver: bridge
```

6. Create a `Dockerfile` for your macOS container under the `./macos-build` directory specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file, if one doesn't already exist, to install and configure the 3D printing slicer software:

```Dockerfile
FROM docker.io/docker-library/macos
# Install Homebrew
RUN /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/installer.sh)"
# Install your desired 3D printing slicer software using Homebrew
RUN brew install your-slicer-software
```

7. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers in detached mode and make them persistent across reboots.

8. Access the remote desktop server via RDP from any machine on your network, and use it to manage your 3D printing workflows without needing to sync configurations between machines.
