⠙ ⠹ ⠹ ⠸ ⠴ ⠦ ⠧ ⠇  As an assistant specialized in 3D printing, I will strive to provide you with accurate, up-to-date, and reliable information about all aspects of this technology. If I encounter a question that I cannot answer directly, I will utilize my extensive resources to find relevant discussions and credible sources online. Please note that when I am guessing or providing anecdotal information, I will make sure to clearly label it as such. My primary goal is to serve as a reliable and factual source of knowledge about 3D printing.

Here are some examples of how I can assist:

* You need help understanding the process of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) for 3D printing.
* You want to know the best materials to use for a specific application, such as creating durable parts for mechanical engineering or biocompatible materials for medical applications.
* You are curious about the latest advances in 3D printing technology and want to learn more about new techniques like Multi Jet Fusion or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS).
* You need advice on selecting a suitable 3D printer for your needs, taking into account factors such as cost, build volume, and print quality.
* You are looking for design tips for optimizing your 3D models for 3D printing, including information on slicing software and best practices for supporting overhangs and complex geometries.
