For managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration on Proxmox, I recommend using a containerized remote desktop environment that provides a centralized and isolated workspace. Based on your preference for macOS, here are some options:

1. **Parallels Remote Desktop**: A commercial solution that allows you to create a macOS virtual machine in Proxmox with remote access. It provides a seamless integration with Proxmox and supports 3D printing slicer configuration.
2. **VMware Horizon**: Another commercial solution that enables you to create a Windows or Linux-based virtual desktop in Proxmox, which can be accessed remotely using the VMware Horizon Client. You can install 3D printing slicer software on this virtual machine.

However, if you're looking for an open-source option with a similar experience to macOS, consider:

1. **Tails**: A live operating system based on Debian that provides a secure and isolated environment. Tails is available in a containerized form called Tails Containers, which can be run on Proxmox.
2. **KVM**: KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is an open-source solution for running virtual machines on Linux-based systems like Proxmox. You can install macOS or Windows on a KVM instance and access it remotely.

For 3D printing slicer configuration, consider the following software:

1. **Slicestep**: A cloud-based 3D printing slicer that allows you to configure and share slicers with others.
2. **PrusaSlicer**: An open-source 3D printing slicer for Cura, which can be run on a virtual machine or within a container.

To avoid syncing configurations between machines, you can use:

1. **Containerization**: Run your workflow in a container, ensuring each container has its own isolated environment.
2. **Persistent storage**: Use persistent storage solutions like Proxmox's CSI storage or external storage solutions to store configuration files and workflows.

Example of a setup using Parallels Remote Desktop:

* Create a new virtual machine in Proxmox with the desired operating system (macOS, Windows, or Linux).
* Install Parallels Remote Desktop software on the virtual machine.
* Configure the remote desktop settings to allow access from your preferred client.
* Set up persistent storage for configuration files and workflows.

Example of a setup using KVM:

* Create a new virtual machine in Proxmox with the desired operating system (macOS, Windows, or Linux).
* Install KVM software on the virtual machine.
* Configure the KVM settings to allow access from your preferred client.
* Set up persistent storage for configuration files and workflows.

Before choosing an option, consider factors such as:

* Performance requirements
* Security needs
* Ease of use
* Cost (if applicable)
* Compatibility with your existing infrastructure

It's recommended to test each solution to determine the best fit for your specific use case.
