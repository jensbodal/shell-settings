For managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration on Proxmox, I'd recommend using a containerized remote desktop environment that provides a stable and secure platform for users. Based on your requirements, here are some top contenders:

1. **Parallels Desktop**: Parallels is a popular remote desktop solution that supports macOS, Linux, and Windows containers. It provides a seamless and responsive experience, allowing users to interact with their 3D printing workflow without interruptions. Proxmox has official support for Parallels.
2. **VMware Horizon**: VMware Horizon is another popular remote desktop platform that offers containerized environments for various operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Windows. It provides a robust security framework and scalable infrastructure, making it suitable for large-scale workflows like 3D printing.
3. **VirtualBox**: VirtualBox is an open-source virtualization platform that supports containerized environments for multiple operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Windows. While not as polished as Parallels or VMware Horizon, VirtualBox offers a flexible and affordable solution for managing remote desktop environments on Proxmox.
4. **Raspberry Pi-based solutions**: If you're looking for an even more lightweight and cost-effective option, consider using Raspberry Pi-based solutions like **PiVPN** or **PiRemoteDesktop**. These solutions provide a compact, containerized environment that can run on a Raspberry Pi device, offering a cost-effective way to manage 3D printing workflows.

All of these options can be used with Proxmox and offer a range of benefits for managing persistent workflows. Here's a brief summary:

* **Parallels Desktop**: Provides a seamless user experience, robust security features, and official support from Proxmox.
* **VMware Horizon**: Offers a scalable infrastructure, robust security features, and a more comprehensive set of tools for managing remote desktop environments.
* **VirtualBox**: Provides a flexible and affordable solution with open-source software.
* **Raspberry Pi-based solutions**: Offers a compact, cost-effective option with a smaller footprint.

Before making a final decision, consider the following factors:

1. **User experience**: How important is the user experience to your users? If you need a seamless and responsive experience, Parallels Desktop or VMware Horizon might be a better choice.
2. **Security**: What level of security do you require for your workflow? If you need robust security features, VMware Horizon or Parallels Desktop might be a better fit.
3. **Scalability**: How many users will be accessing the remote desktop environment? If you expect a high volume of users, VMware Horizon or Parallels Desktop might be more suitable.
4. **Cost**: What is your budget for this solution? Raspberry Pi-based solutions can be an attractive option if you're looking for a cost-effective solution.

Ultimately, I recommend evaluating each option based on your specific requirements and choosing the one that best fits your needs.
