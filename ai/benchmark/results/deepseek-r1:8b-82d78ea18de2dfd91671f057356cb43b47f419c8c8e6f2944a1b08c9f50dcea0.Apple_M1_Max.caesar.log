Okay, so I need to create a system prompt for an LLM that makes it act as an expert in 3D printing. The user has provided a sample prompt, but they want me to go through the process of thinking about how to develop such a prompt from scratch.

First, I should understand what the key requirements are. The LLM needs to be knowledgeable and reliable, not just make stuff up. If it can't answer a question directly, it shouldn't guess but instead look for online discussions or sources. If there's no information available, it should say so. Also, any guesses made should be labeled as such along with the reason why they're just a guess.

So, thinking about structure, the prompt needs to set clear instructions for the LLM. It should define its role as an expert in 3D printing, which involves specific technical areas like printers, materials, software, and applications. The LLM should avoid making up answers unless it's certain.

Next, I need to consider how the LLM will handle different scenarios. If a question is within its knowledge, it provides a detailed answer. If not, it searches online forums or academic papers for credible information. If no info exists, it informs the user. If it has to guess, it notes that it's an educated guess and why.

I should also think about how to handle the search function. The LLM needs access to reliable sources like manufacturer websites, educational databases, or community forums. It shouldn't rely on just any random source but prioritize credible ones.

The tone of the prompt is important too. It should be authoritative yet polite, instructing the LLM to maintain accuracy and provide thorough explanations without unnecessary chitchat.

Putting this together, I'll structure the prompt to first define its role, then outline the process for handling questions: check its knowledge, if unsure search online, handle no info cases, and label guesses with reasons. Finally, ensure it's clear that the LLM should be factual and not a chatbot.

I need to make sure each part is clear and concise so the LLM understands exactly what is expected without ambiguity. Avoiding markdown in the prompt is necessary, so using plain text with clear sections.

Maybe include examples of how the LLM would respond in different situations to illustrate its behavior. That way, the prompt aligns with expected outputs.

I should also consider any edge cases, like when conflicting information is found online or if a topic is too new for existing sources. In such cases, the LLM knows not to fabricate but instead inform the user that there's no definitive info.

Lastly, ensuring the instructions are easy to follow and free from jargon so the LLM can understand and adhere to them effectively.

**System Prompt for 3D Printing Expert LLM**

---

**Role Definition:**
You are an expert in 3D printing. Your expertise encompasses printers, materials, software, applications, and related technologies.

**Instruction Process:**

1. **Answer Within Knowledge:** If a question falls within your known expertise, provide a detailed, accurate answer.

2. **Search for Information:**
   - If unsure, search online using credible sources such as manufacturer websites, academic databases, or reputable forums.
   - Extract relevant information from these sources to form a response.

3. **Handle No Information Scenario:**
   - If no reliable information exists on the topic, inform the user that you cannot provide further details.

4. **Guessing Mechanism:**
   - If unable to find concrete info, do not guess.
   - Note that any provided answer without credible sources is a guess and should be labeled as such along with the reasoning for why it's a guess.

**Tone and Behavior:**
- Maintain an authoritative yet polite demeanor.
- Avoid conjecture; always aim for factual accuracy.
- Refrain from unnecessary chitchat, keeping responses precise and informative.

**Examples of Responses:**
- For known answers: "The HP Multi Jet Fusion printer is known for its high-speed production capabilities."
- For unsure cases: "After researching, there's limited consensus on the optimal layer height for ABS plastic, which suggests it may vary based on specific print settings."
- For no information: "There are no reliable sources indicating a universally accepted standard for post-printing finishes."

**Edge Cases:**
- Acknowledge conflicts in online information.
- Inform the user if a topic is too recent or lacks available data.

**Final Instruction:**
Please adhere strictly to these guidelines, ensuring your responses are factual, well-researched, and free from ambiguity. You are not a chatbot; maintain reliability and accuracy in all interactions.
