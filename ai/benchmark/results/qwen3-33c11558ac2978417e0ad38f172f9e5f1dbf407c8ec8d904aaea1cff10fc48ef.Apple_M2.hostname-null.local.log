Okay, the user wants to set up a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox to manage persistent workflows, specifically for 3D printing slicer configuration. They prefer macOS but are open to Linux or Windows. The main goal is to avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing everything in a local remote desktop.

First, I need to figure out the best containerized remote desktop solution for Proxmox. Proxmox uses LXC and KVM, so maybe a containerized solution that runs within Proxmox. Let's think about options.

VirtualBox or VMware are possible, but they might not be containerized. The user mentioned containerized, so maybe something like Docker or LXC/LXD. But remote desktop environments usually need a full desktop, which might be tricky in containers. Wait, maybe there's a way to run a desktop environment inside a container.

Wait, maybe using a containerized desktop solution. For example, there's a project called "Tailscale" or "ZeroTier" for network, but that's not directly related. Alternatively, there's "VNC" or "X11 forwarding" but that's more for remote access than a full desktop environment.

Wait, maybe using a container that runs a full desktop environment. For example, using a Docker container with a Linux desktop, like XFCE or GNOME. But then you need to connect to it via VNC or RDP. But the user wants a remote desktop environment, so maybe a solution that provides a full GUI.

But macOS isn't typically run in containers. So if the user prefers macOS, maybe they need to run a macOS VM. But Proxmox can run KVM VMs, so maybe a macOS VM is an option. However, macOS licensing is a bit of a problem. Apple doesn't allow running macOS in virtual machines, so that might be an issue. So if they want macOS, maybe they need to use a VM, but that's not containerized. The user might be looking for a containerized solution, but macOS in containers is not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe they can use a Linux container with a desktop environment that mimics macOS, but that's not really macOS. So perhaps the user is okay with Linux or Windows. Let me check.

The user says macOS is preferred but Linux or Windows are acceptable. So maybe they can use a Linux container with a desktop environment. However, for 3D printing slicers, some are macOS-specific, like Cura or others. But maybe they can use a Linux version. Alternatively, use a Windows container, but again, Windows containers are not as common in Proxmox as Linux containers.

Wait, Proxmox supports both LXC and KVM. So maybe using a KVM VM for macOS is the way to go, but that's not containerized. The user wants containerized. So perhaps the answer is to use a containerized Linux desktop environment, and if macOS is needed, maybe use a VM but that's not containerized. But the user might be okay with that if the main goal is to centralize configurations.

Alternatively, there's a project called "Docker Desktop" which allows running containers with a GUI, but that's more for Windows or macOS. But Proxmox can run Docker, but Docker itself is a container runtime. Maybe using Docker to run a desktop environment.

Wait, but running a full desktop in a container is possible with tools like "X11 forwarding" or using a container that has a GUI. For example, using a container with XFCE and then connecting via VNC. But that's more of a setup. Alternatively, using a remote desktop service like XRDP or something else.

Another thought: the user wants persistent workflows. So the container needs to have persistent storage. So maybe using Proxmox's container storage, like LVM or ZFS, to have persistent data.

So possible options:

1. Use a Linux container with a desktop environment (like XFCE, GNOME) and remote access via VNC or RDP. This is containerized, but requires setting up the desktop environment inside the container.

2. Use a Windows container, but Windows containers are limited in Proxmox, and maybe not as straightforward. Also, Windows might not be the best for 3D printing slicers, but some are available.

3. Use a macOS VM via KVM, but that's not containerized and has licensing issues.

But the user wants containerized. So maybe the first option is better. Let me think about how to set up a container with a desktop.

For example, using a Docker image that includes a desktop environment. There are images like "linuxserver/xfce" or "rancher/os" with desktop. Then, you can access it via VNC. But you need to expose the VNC port and set up the container accordingly.

Alternatively, using a container with XRDP, which allows RDP access. But that requires setting up the desktop environment and XRDP server inside the container.

But maybe it's easier to use a container that runs a full desktop and then access it via a remote desktop client. For example, using a container with a GNOME desktop and then using VNC.

Another option is using a tool like "Remmina" or "TightVNC" to connect to the container. But the user might prefer a more seamless experience.

Alternatively, using a containerized remote desktop solution like "NoVNC" or "Guacamole", but those are more for web-based access.

Wait, maybe the user is looking for a container that hosts a remote desktop server, like a Windows Server or macOS server, but that's not containerized. So maybe the answer is to use a VM for macOS, but that's not containerized. However, the user might not mind that if the main goal is to have persistent configurations.

But the user specifically mentioned containerized. So perhaps the best approach is to use a Linux container with a desktop environment and remote access, and if macOS is needed, use a VM but that's not containerized. However, the user prefers macOS, so maybe they can use a macOS VM with Proxmox, even though it's not containerized. But the licensing issue is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe using a macOS container via some other method. I know that Apple doesn't allow macOS to run in virtual machines, so that's not possible. Therefore, the user might have to use a Linux or Windows container.

So, considering the user's preference for macOS but accepting Linux or Windows, perhaps the best option is to use a Linux container with a desktop environment, but if they need macOS, they can use a VM. However, the user wants containerized, so maybe the answer is to use a Linux container.

But the user mentioned "centralizing the workflow in a local remote desktop." So maybe they need a remote desktop that's accessible from their local machine, but the server is running on Proxmox.

Another thought: using Proxmox's LXC containers with a desktop environment. For example, using a container based on Ubuntu with XFCE, then exposing the VNC or RDP service.

So, steps would be:

1. Create a container in Proxmox with a Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)

2. Install a desktop environment like XFCE

3. Install a VNC server or XRDP to allow remote access

4. Connect via VNC or RDP client

This would allow the user to have a persistent environment where they can configure the 3D slicer, and since it's in a container, the configuration is stored there, avoiding syncing between machines.

Alternatively, using Docker to run a container with a desktop environment. But Docker on Proxmox might be a bit more involved, but possible.

Another consideration: the user wants to avoid syncing configurations between machines. So by having a centralized remote desktop, all configurations are stored in that environment, which is managed through the Proxmox container.

So, for the best containerized solution, maybe using a Linux container with a desktop environment and remote access. For macOS, if possible, but due to licensing, it's not feasible. So, the answer would be to use a Linux container with a desktop environment and remote access, and if macOS is needed, use a VM but that's not containerized.

But the user might be okay with that. So, the best containerized option is a Linux desktop container, and for macOS, use a VM. But since the user prefers macOS, maybe they can use a VM with macOS, but that's not containerized. However, the user might have to accept that.

Alternatively, there's a macOS container solution called "macOS in a container" but I'm not sure if that's possible. Probably not, due to licensing and the way macOS is designed.

So, the answer would be to use a Linux container with a desktop environment (like XFCE) and remote access (VNC or RDP), which is containerized and allows persistent workflows. If macOS is needed, use a VM, but that's not containerized. However, the user might prefer that for macOS.

Alternatively, using a Windows container, but again, Windows containers are less common in Proxmox and might have limitations.

So, the best options are:

- For macOS: Use a macOS VM in Proxmox (but not containerized, and licensing issues)

- For Linux: Use a container with a desktop environment and remote access.

But the user wants containerized. So the answer would be to use a Linux container with a desktop environment, and if macOS is needed, use a VM. But the user might have to accept that macOS isn't containerized.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to run macOS in a container via some other method, but I don't think that's possible.

Therefore, the best containerized remote desktop environment is a Linux container with a desktop environment and remote access. For macOS, a VM is the only option, but it's not containerized. So the answer would be to use a Linux container for the remote desktop, and if macOS is needed, use a VM.

But the user might want a macOS solution. So maybe they can use a macOS VM, even though it's not containerized. The user might be okay with that if the main goal is to centralize configurations.

So, the final answer would be to use a containerized Linux desktop environment for the remote desktop, and if macOS is needed, use a VM. But since the user prefers macOS, maybe they can use a macOS VM, but that's not containerized. However, the user might not mind that if the main goal is persistence.

To achieve a **containerized remote desktop environment** on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, here's a structured approach tailored to your requirements:

---

### **Best Solution: Linux Container with Remote Desktop Access**
**Why Linux?**  
- **Containerization**: Linux containers (LXC/LXD or Docker) are well-supported in Proxmox.  
- **Persistent Workflows**: Linux environments can host 3D printing slicers (e.g., Cura, Slic3r) and allow centralized configuration storage.  
- **No Licensing Issues**: Avoids macOS licensing constraints.  

**Steps to Implement:**
1. **Proxmox Container Setup**  
   - Create a **Linux container** (e.g., Ubuntu/Debian) in Proxmox.  
   - Use **LXC/LXD** or **Docker** for containerization.  

2. **Install a Desktop Environment**  
   - Example: Install **XFCE** or **GNOME** for a lightweight GUI.  
     ```bash
     apt update && apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies x11-apps
     ```
   - Alternatively, use **Docker** with a pre-configured desktop image (e.g., `linuxserver/xfce`).

3. **Enable Remote Access**  
   - **VNC**: Install a VNC server (e.g., `tightvncserver`) and expose the port.  
   - **XRDP**: Install `xrdp` for RDP access (ideal for Windows/macOS clients).  
     ```bash
     apt install xrdp
     systemctl enable xrdp
     systemctl start xrdp
     ```

4. **Access the Container**  
   - Use a **VNC client** (e.g., RealVNC, TigerVNC) or **RDP client** (e.g., Microsoft Remote Desktop) to connect.  

5. **Persistent Storage**  
   - Mount Proxmox storage (e.g., LVM, ZFS) to the container to retain configurations across reboots.  

---

### **Alternative: macOS VM (Not Containerized)**
**Why Use a VM?**  
- **macOS Compatibility**: Required for macOS-specific slicers (e.g., Cura for macOS).  
- **Licensing Note**: Apple restricts macOS from running in virtual machines, but **Boot Camp** or **Parallels Desktop** (with a license) can be used.  

**Steps for macOS VM:**  
1. **Create a macOS VM in Proxmox**  
   - Use **KVM** to run macOS (requires a valid macOS license and Boot Camp).  
   - Download macOS ISO from Apple and install via Proxmox's VM setup.  

2. **Install 3D Slicer**  
   - Install slicer software (e.g., Cura, Simplify3D) and configure workflows.  

3. **Access via Remote Desktop**  
   - Use **Screen Sharing** (macOS) or **RDP/VNC** with a macOS server (e.g., via `xrdp` or `vnc4server`).  

**Drawbacks**:  
- Not containerized.  
- Licensing restrictions for macOS in VMs.  

---

### **Why Not Use Windows Containers?**  
- **Windows containers** are less common in Proxmox and may lack GUI support.  
- 3D printing slicers often have Linux/macOS versions; Windows is not ideal for this use case.  

---

### **Summary of Recommendations**
| Requirement | Recommendation | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| **macOS Preference** | macOS VM (KVM) | Avoid licensing issues with Boot Camp/Parallels. |
| **Linux/Windows Acceptance** | Linux Container | Best for containerization and persistent workflows. |
| **Persistent Workflows** | Containerized Storage | Use Proxmox storage (LVM/ZFS) for persistent data. |
| **Remote Access** | VNC/XRDP | Choose based on client OS (Windows/macOS). |

---

### **Final Answer**
**Best Option**: Use a **Linux container** (e.g., Ubuntu with XFCE) for containerized remote desktop access, as it balances containerization, persistence, and compatibility with 3D printing workflows. For macOS-specific needs, use a **macOS VM** in Proxmox (via KVM) with appropriate licensing. This setup avoids syncing configurations between machines by centralizing workflows in a single, persistent environment.
