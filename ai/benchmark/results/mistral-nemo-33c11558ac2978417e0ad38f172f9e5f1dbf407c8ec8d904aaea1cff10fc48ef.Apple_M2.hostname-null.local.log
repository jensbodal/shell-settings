⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠼ ⠴ ⠦ Based on your requirements, I would recommend using the following containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration:

1. **macOS**: You mentioned macOS as your preferred choice.

   - **XQuartz** (macOS X server) along with a VNC server to create a remote desktop for macOS. However, running macOS in Proxmox requires Apple's license agreement and might have performance limitations.
   - *Containerization*: You can use `docker-mac` or `podman-mac` to run macOS containers.

2. **Linux**:

   - **Xfce or LXDE** (lightweight desktop environments) with a VNC server for remote access.
   - *Containerization*: Use Docker or Podman to create Linux containers. You can use images like `linuxserver/xfce-desktop` or create your own custom image.

3. **Windows**:

   - **Remote Desktop Services (RDS)** along with a VNC server or **NoMachine's NX Server** for remote access.
   - *Containerization*: Use Windows containers in Proxmox, either via Docker or Hyper-V containers. You can use the `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019` image as a base.

To ensure persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration:

- **Persistent Data**: Mount a host directory as a shared volume in your container, so that changes are saved outside the container.
- **Container Snapshots/Backups**: Regularly create snapshots or backups of your containers to preserve their state.

To avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing the workflow:

- **Centralized Storage**: Use a centralized storage solution like NFS (Network File System) or iSCSI shared by all remote desktop environments. This way, your 3D printing slicer configuration files and other data are accessible from any connected machine.
- **Shared Configuration Files**: Store configuration files in the centralized storage location, and mount this directory as a volume in each container.

Here's an example of how you can run a Linux container with Xfce and VNC server on Proxmox:

```bash
docker run -d --name xfce-vnc \
  -v /path/to/centralized/storage:/home/user/config \
  -p 5901:5901 \
  --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri \
  linuxserver/xfce-desktop:latest
```

This command creates a Linux container with Xfce and VNC server, mounts the centralized storage directory as `/home/user/config` inside the container, exposes VNC on port 5901, and maps the GPU (`/dev/dri`) for better graphics performance.
