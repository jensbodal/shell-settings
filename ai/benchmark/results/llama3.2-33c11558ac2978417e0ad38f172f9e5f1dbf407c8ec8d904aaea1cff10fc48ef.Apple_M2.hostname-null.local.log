⠙ ⠹ For a centralized and secure remote desktop environment on Proxmox, I'd recommend considering the following containerized options:

1. **VMware Horizon Cloud**: A cloud-native platform that allows you to centrally manage and deliver Windows, Linux, and macOS desktops as virtual apps or windows. It supports Proxmox VE as a backend infrastructure.
2. **Citrix Hypervisor (formerly XenServer)**: An open-source hypervisor that provides a scalable and secure environment for containerized remote desktops. Citrix offers a range of products, including Virtual Apps and Desktops, which can be integrated with Proxmox VE.
3. **VMware vSphere**: A virtualization platform that allows you to create and manage virtual machines, as well as containers. You can use VMware vCenter Server to manage your Proxmox infrastructure and deploy containerized remote desktop environments.

For a macOS-based environment, consider the following options:

1. **macOS in a Docker container**: You can run macOS inside a Docker container on your Proxmox server using tools like Docker-machine or Boot Camp Assistant. This approach requires some configuration and optimization to ensure smooth performance.
2. **Parallels Desktop for Proxmox**: A Linux-based application that allows you to run macOS as a virtual machine within a Proxmox container.

For a Linux-based environment, consider:

1. **Linux in a Docker container**: You can run a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu or CentOS) inside a Docker container on your Proxmox server.
2. **KVM-based Linux containers**: KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a popular hypervisor for Linux that allows you to create and manage virtual machines, including containers.

For 3D printing slicer configuration workflows, consider the following:

1. **Use a web-based interface**: Develop or use an existing web application that can handle your 3D printing requirements. This approach eliminates the need for remote desktop access.
2. **Containerize a local workflow**: Run your 3D printing software (e.g., Cura or Slic3r) inside a container on your Proxmox server, and provide a web-based interface to interact with it.

To avoid syncing configurations between machines:

1. **Use a centralized configuration store**: Implement a centralized storage solution, such as a network-attached storage (NAS) or object storage, to store your 3D printing settings and configurations.
2. **Use a containerized workflow**: Run your 3D printing software inside a container on your Proxmox server, and configure it to use the centralized configuration store.

When choosing a solution, consider factors such as:

* Performance requirements
* Security and compliance needs
* Compatibility with existing infrastructure and applications
* Ease of management and maintenance
* Cost and licensing

Based on these considerations, I'd recommend starting with a Linux-based containerized environment (e.g., Docker) to run your 3D printing software. This approach provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness while minimizing the need for remote desktop access.
