â ™ For a containerized remote desktop environment that can manage persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, I'd recommend using Proxmox and a combination of Docker and Open Remote Desktop (ORD) or similar tools. Here's a suggested setup:

1. **Proxmox:** Use Proxmox as the host for your remote desktop infrastructure. It provides a robust and scalable platform for running containers.
2. **Docker:** Use Docker to containerize your applications. This will ensure that each workflow runs independently without dependencies on other machines.
3. **MacOS (with Linux or Windows)**: For the macOS-based workflows, you can use a Mac mini, iMac, or similar hardware as the host for your Proxmox cluster.

For a preferred setup, I'd suggest:

1. Create a separate container for each workflow using Docker Compose.
2. Use a Linux-based workflow (e.g., Ubuntu or Debian) for 3D printing slicer configuration and other workflows that don't require macOS-specific applications.
3. If you prefer to use macOS, create a virtual machine (VM) within Proxmox with a macOS operating system.

Here's an example of how you can set up your containerized remote desktop environment:

**Linux-based workflow (e.g., Ubuntu):**

* Create a Docker Compose file (e.g., `docker-compose.yml`) that defines the services for your 3D printing slicer configuration workflow:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  slicer-config:
    image: my-slicer-config-image
    volumes:
      - ./slicer-config:/config
      - ./workflows:/workflows
```
* Run `docker-compose up` to start the container and mount the `./slicer-config` directory as a volume.

**MacOS (with Linux or Windows) based workflow:**

* Create a Proxmox VM with macOS and install the necessary software for your 3D printing slicer configuration workflow.
* Mount a shared volume from Proxmox to store configuration files.
* Use Docker Compose to run a container for your macOS-based workflow:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  macos-slicer-config:
    image: my-macos-slicer-config-image
    volumes:
      - ./macos-slicer-config:/config
```
In both cases, use Open Remote Desktop (ORD) or similar tools to connect to the containerized remote desktop environment. This will allow you to access your workflows from any machine with a browser or using a remote desktop client.

To avoid syncing configurations between machines:

1. Use a secure, encrypted volume store for storing configuration files.
2. Configure Docker volumes to persist data even when containers are restarted or deleted.
3. Set up Proxmox's file-level replication feature to synchronize changes between containers.

By following this setup, you'll have a centralized remote desktop environment that manages persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration without requiring syncing configurations between machines.
