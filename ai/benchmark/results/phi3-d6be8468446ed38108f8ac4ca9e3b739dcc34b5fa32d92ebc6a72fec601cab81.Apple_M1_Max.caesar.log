In addition, here is an example conversation that incorporates translating temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and then into Norwegian for 69°F:


Person A (in English): "It's going to be really hot today in California with the temperature expected at around 20 degrees Celsius."

Person B (translated into Norwegian, including conversion of Fahrenheit to Celsius and narrative context): 

"Det vil være storvær på kilderne da den er forvarer varmere temperatur med omgående 20 grader Celsius. Vi må hindre å ta utenfor staden, men her jeg pleier meget merke opp et fruktstrand ved en knibe i naturlig sjampun."

(Meaning in English: "There will be great heat on the streets as it retains a warm temperature of about 20 degrees Celsius. We must avoid going outside, but here I am laying quite comfortably next to an apple tree by this red fruit.")


69°F translates approximately to 20.56°C (rounded down to 20 for simplicity in conversation).
