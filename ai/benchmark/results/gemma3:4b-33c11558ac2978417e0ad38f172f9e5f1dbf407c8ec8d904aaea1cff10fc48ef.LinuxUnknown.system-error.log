Okay, let's break down the best containerized remote desktop environments for Proxmox, specifically geared towards persistent 3D printing workflows like managing slicer configurations. Your requirements – centralization, avoiding syncing, and macOS/Linux/Windows compatibility – are key.

Here's a breakdown of the top contenders, with recommendations and considerations:

**1. Remmina + Docker (Highly Recommended - Flexibility & Maturity)**

* **Why it's good:** This is arguably the most versatile and mature solution. It leverages Remmina (a fantastic open-source VNC/RDP client) and Docker, giving you granular control and integration.
* **How it works:**
    * **Docker Container:** You create a Docker container that runs your desired remote desktop server (VNC, RDP, or even TeamViewer).
    * **Remmina:** Remmina connects to the Docker container, acting as your client.  You configure Remmina to connect to the container’s IP address and port.
    * **Persistent Configuration:** Because the remote desktop server runs *inside* the container, its configuration persists.  You don't need to worry about syncing.
* **Remote Desktop Server Options within the Container:**
    * **VNC:** Easy to set up, widely supported.
    * **RDP (xrdp):**  Allows you to use the familiar Windows RDP client, perfect if you want to run Windows-based slicing software.
    * **TeamViewer:** Simple and intuitive.  Can be slightly less configurable than native solutions.
* **Pros:**
    * **Highly Customizable:** Docker provides a robust environment for tweaking and optimizing.
    * **Flexibility:**  Supports VNC, RDP, and TeamViewer.
    * **Mature:**  Remmina and Docker are well-established.
    * **Proxmox Integration:** Docker works seamlessly within Proxmox.
* **Cons:**
    * **More Setup:**  Requires some Docker and Remmina knowledge.
    * **Potential Performance Overhead:**  Docker adds a small layer of overhead, though this is usually negligible.
* **Example Dockerfile (for RDP with xrdp):**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y xrdp xfce4 xfce4-terminal

EXPOSE 3389  # RDP port

CMD ["/usr/bin/xfce4-session"]
```


**2.  TightVNC + Docker (Good for macOS/Windows simplicity)**

* **Why it's good:**  TightVNC is a lightweight, popular VNC server, and Docker provides the containerization. This is a great option if you primarily want a macOS experience.
* **How it works:** Similar to Remmina + TightVNC. You’d run TightVNC inside a Docker container and connect using a VNC client on your Proxmox host.
* **Pros:**
    * **Lightweight:** TightVNC is very efficient.
    * **Good macOS Support:** Works well within macOS.
* **Cons:**
    * **Less Feature-Rich:**  Compared to VNC, TightVNC can be less feature-rich.
    * **Configuration:** Still requires some Docker knowledge.

**3.  XFCE RDP (Specialized - Windows Slicing Focus)**

* **Why it's good:**  Specifically designed for running Windows desktop environments inside Docker containers.  Excellent for running Windows-based slicing software like PrusaSlicer or Cura.
* **How it works:**  A pre-built Docker image that sets up XFCE with RDP.
* **Pros:**
    * **Optimized for Windows:**  Designed specifically for Windows.
    * **Simple to Use:**  Easy to deploy.
* **Cons:**
    * **Windows Only:**  Obviously.
    * **Less Flexibility:**  Less customizable than a vanilla Docker setup.


**4.  TeamViewer Business Plus (Simplest - Managed Solution)**

* **Why it's good:**  TeamViewer is incredibly easy to set up and manage. It's a fully managed solution.
* **How it works:** You deploy the TeamViewer Business Plus container to Proxmox, and it handles all the server aspects.
* **Pros:**
    * **Extremely Easy to Set Up:** Very user-friendly.
    * **Good Performance:**  Generally reliable.
* **Cons:**
    * **Cost:**  TeamViewer Business Plus is a paid service.
    * **Less Control:**  You're reliant on TeamViewer's infrastructure.



**Recommendation – Prioritization**

* **Best Overall (Most Flexible):** **Remmina + Docker (with xrdp or VNC)** -  Offers the best balance of flexibility, control, and support for various remote desktop protocols and operating systems. It’s the most versatile for your needs.

* **Easiest Setup (if you're okay with a managed service):** **TeamViewer Business Plus** - If ease of use and minimal administration are paramount.

* **Windows Slicing Focus:** **XFCE RDP** – If your primary use case is running Windows-based slicing software.

**Proxmox Considerations**

* **Networking:** Make sure your Proxmox host has a static IP address or is configured to receive dynamic DNS updates so you can reliably connect to the Docker container.
* **Firewall:** Configure your Proxmox firewall to allow connections on the port used by your chosen remote desktop server (e.g., 3389 for RDP, 5900 for VNC).

To help me refine my recommendation further, could you tell me:

*   **What slicing software do you plan to use?** (PrusaSlicer, Cura, etc.)
*   **What's your level of technical comfort with Docker and remote desktop protocols?** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
*   **Do you have a specific operating system preference?** (macOS, Windows, Linux)?
