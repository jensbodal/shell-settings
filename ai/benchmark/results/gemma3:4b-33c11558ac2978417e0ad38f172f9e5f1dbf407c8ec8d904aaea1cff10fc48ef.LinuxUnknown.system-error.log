Okay, let's break down the best containerized remote desktop environments for Proxmox, specifically geared toward persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations. You’re aiming for a central, locally-managed solution, avoiding syncing across machines. Here’s a breakdown of options, ranked with considerations for your needs:

**Top Tier – Highly Recommended**

1. **Xojo Remote Desktop:**
   * **Containerization:**  Runs beautifully in Docker containers, specifically tailored for Proxmox.
   * **macOS Focus:**  Designed with macOS in mind, offering a native-like experience.  It’s a fantastic choice if you *absolutely* need macOS.
   * **Persistence:**  Crucially, it uses Docker volumes to preserve your slicer configurations and software installations *across* reboots. This is the single biggest advantage for your workflow.
   * **Features:**
      * Full macOS Desktop:  Seamless macOS experience.
      * Slicer Support: Directly integrates with Cura, PrusaSlicer, etc.
      * Excellent Performance: Optimized for remote access.
      * Easy Setup: Simplified Docker setup guides for Proxmox.
   * **Cost:** Paid, but a one-time cost and relatively affordable.

2. **VNC with Docker + MacVNC/TightVNC:**
   * **Containerization:**  A standard Docker container for the VNC server.
   * **Flexibility:**  Works with macOS, Linux, and Windows.
   * **Persistence:** You *must* set this up carefully using Docker volumes to ensure configuration persistence. This is the most challenging aspect of this approach.
   * **Features:**
      * Broad Compatibility:  Compatible with almost any VNC client.
      * Relatively lightweight:  Low resource usage.
   * **Cost:** Free (as in beer)
   * **Setup Complexity:** Higher than Xojo, requiring more manual volume configuration.

**Second Tier – Good Options with Caveats**

3. **Remmina + Docker + macOS Desktop:**
    * **Containerization:**  Docker container running a macOS desktop environment (using a VM image).
    * **Flexibility:**  Works with macOS, Linux, and Windows.
    * **Persistence:** Similar to Remmina, you need to manage Docker volumes for persistent storage.
    * **Features:**
        * Flexible VNC Client: Uses VNC for the remote desktop connection.
    * **Cost:** Free
    * **Setup Complexity:** Moderate, requiring knowledge of Docker and VNC.

4. **TigerVNC + Docker + macOS Desktop:**
    * Very similar to Remmina and TigerVNC+Docker. It is a good alternative if you’re familiar with TigerVNC.

**Why These Choices Are Good For Your Workflow**

* **Centralized Control:**  All configurations live in the Proxmox container, eliminating syncing headaches.
* **Persistent Environments:**  The Docker volume setup is key. This means your slicer profiles, settings, plugins, and installed software stay put even after the container is restarted.
* **Proxmox Integration:** Docker containers integrate seamlessly with Proxmox’s resource management and monitoring.

**Here's a table summarizing the key differences:**

| Feature          | Xojo Remote Desktop | Remmina + VNC | TigerVNC + Docker + macOS |
|------------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Containerization** | Yes (Docker)           | Yes (Docker)  | Yes (Docker)              |
| **macOS Support**  | Excellent, Native       | Good          | Good                       |
| **Persistence**    | Excellent (Volumes)     | Requires Careful Setup | Requires Careful Setup     |
| **Ease of Setup** | High                  | Moderate      | Moderate                   |
| **Cost**           | Paid                   | Free          | Free                      |


**Recommendations:**

1. **Best Overall:** **Xojo Remote Desktop** is almost certainly the best choice for your specific needs. The macOS experience, ease of setup, and guaranteed persistence with Docker volumes are extremely compelling.

2. **Budget-Friendly Option:** If cost is a major concern, **Remmina + VNC** is a viable alternative, but be prepared to invest time in setting up the Docker volumes correctly.

**Important Notes and Setup Considerations:**

* **Docker Volumes:** *Always* use Docker volumes for storing your persistent data. Without them, your configurations will be lost when the container is rebuilt or restarted.
* **Resource Allocation:**  Give your container enough CPU and RAM to handle the 3D printing slicer and any other applications you’ll be running.
* **Network Configuration:**  Ensure your Proxmox host has a stable network connection for remote access.

To help me narrow down the best recommendation for *you*, could you tell me:

*   **What’s your budget?** (Are you okay with paying for a solution, or are you looking for free options?)
*   **What macOS version are you using?** (This affects compatibility.)
*   **Do you have any prior experience with Docker?**
