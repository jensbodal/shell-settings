⠋ ⠙ ⠹ To achieve a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmux that allows you to manage persistent workflows like 3D printer slicer configurations without having to sync settings across multiple devices, you can consider several options. The primary goal is to create an isolated and consistent environment where your configurations remain unchanged regardless of the host machine you connect from.

Here are some recommended solutions:

### 1. **X11 with VNC or RDP**
- **X11 Forwarding**: You can set up X11 forwarding through SSH. This allows applications running in a container to be displayed on your local desktop.
- **VNC Server/Client**: Install a VNC server inside the container and connect via a VNC client from your macOS, Linux, or Windows machine. Tools like `tigervnc` or `noVNC` can be useful.
- **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**: Use tools like `xrdp` in conjunction with an X11 server to provide RDP access.

### 2. **Docker Containers**
Using Docker, you can easily manage and run isolated environments on Proxmox:

- **Dockerized Applications**: Run your slicer application inside a Docker container. You could use a base image like Ubuntu or Debian.
- **TightVNC/X11RDP**: Install VNC server software inside the container for remote access. Alternatively, set up xrdp to allow RDP connections.

### 3. **KVM/QEMU Virtual Machines**
If you require more comprehensive desktop environments:

- **Proxmox VE KVM VMs**: Create a lightweight Linux or Windows VM with your preferred slicer installed.
- **Remote Desktop Solutions**:
  - For Linux: Use `xrdp` to provide RDP access.
  - For Windows: Install the built-in Remote Desktop Server.

### 4. **Web-Based Solutions**
Consider using web technologies if you prefer not dealing with desktop environments:

- **Docker Containers with Web Interfaces**: Set up a container with a slicer application that provides a web interface, allowing you to manage configurations through a browser.
- **Flask/Django for Custom Interfaces**: Build a custom Python-based web app in a Docker container to manage your workflow.

### 5. **Container Orchestration**
For more complex setups:

- **Kubernetes on Proxmox**: If scalability and resource management are important, consider using Kubernetes to orchestrate containers across the cluster.
  
### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Proxmox VE**: Ensure you have a functioning Proxmox setup.
2. **Choose Your Environment**: Decide whether you want Docker or VM-based solutions.
3. **Install Necessary Software**:
   - For Docker: Set up your preferred slicer in a container with VNC/RDP support.
   - For KVM/QEMU: Create a VM and install the necessary remote desktop software.
4. **Configure Networking**: Ensure the containers/VMs are reachable over the network for remote access.
5. **Access Remotely**: Use a client on your macOS, Linux, or Windows machine to connect to the remote environment.

### Recommended Tools

- **Docker**: For container management (`docker`, `docker-compose`).
- **VNC/RDP Clients**: e.g., `RealVNC Viewer`, Microsoft Remote Desktop.
- **SSH X11 Forwarding**: Built-in support on macOS and Linux for SSH-based X11 forwarding.
  
By setting up a centralized remote desktop environment using these methods, you can manage your 3D printing workflows effectively without the need to sync configurations across multiple machines.
