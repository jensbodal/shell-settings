Fresh and Juicy

**Narrative:**

One day, I found this beautiful, **red apple** on our old wooden table. It looked so fresh and juicy that I couldn't resist the temptation to take a bite. As I was about to do so, I remembered something from my programming class.

We had learned about translating temperatures from Fahrenheit (69°F) to Celsius (°C). The formula is:

`(°F - 32) * 5/9 = °C`

So, 69°F in Celsius would be:

`(69 - 32) * 5/9 = 21°C`

I thought about how this apple felt like a fresh, crisp 21°C day. It was perfect for an afternoon snack!

**Translation Conversation:**

*Me:* "Hey Google, what's 69°F in Celsius?"

*Google:* "That would be 21°C."

*Me:* "Thanks, Google!"
