⠙ ⠙ For creating a centralized remote desktop environment on Proxmox to manage persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, I recommend considering the following options:

1.  **VMware Horizon**: Although not primarily designed for Linux, VMware Horizon is highly scalable and can be used with a variety of operating systems, including macOS.

2.  **Virtual Machines (KVM)**: Proxmox VE comes pre-installed with KVM, which is a great option if you need to run specific versions of Windows or macOS. You could install the necessary applications for your workflow and access them from remote desktop sessions.

3.  **Pulseway**: A powerful remote desktop solution that supports multiple operating systems, including macOS. Pulseway offers a robust set of features suitable for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration.

4.  **UltraVNC/Remote Utilities**: These tools offer the ability to connect from anywhere and provide access to your workspace as if you were sitting right in front of it.

5.  **KVM+Pulseway hybrid solution**: You can use KVM for a lightweight virtual environment and Pulseway for remote desktop functionality, providing an optimal combination of low latency and seamless performance.
