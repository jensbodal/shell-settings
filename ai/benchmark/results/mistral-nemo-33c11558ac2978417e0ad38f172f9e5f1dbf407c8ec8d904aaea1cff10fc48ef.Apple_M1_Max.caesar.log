⠙ ⠹ ⠸ To achieve your goal of running a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration with preference given to macOS, you can use a combination of technologies. Since macOS is not directly supported as a guest OS in Proxmox, we'll focus on Linux and Windows, using Mac-like software where possible.

Here's a suggested setup:

1. **Operating System**: Install Proxmox VE 7.x (based on Debian Buster) as your hypervisor.
2. **Containerization Platform**: Use Docker or Podman for containerizing the remote desktop environment.
3. **Remote Desktop Solution**:
   - For Linux: Use NoMachine's NX Server with the NX Client for a fast and efficient remote desktop experience. You can install the NX Server in a container and access it from your client machine using the NX Client (available on macOS, Windows, and Linux).
   - For Windows: Use Microsoft's Remote Desktop Services (RDS) or alternatives like x2go with Xming for displaying X windows on Windows.
4. **3D Printing Software**:
   - For Mac-like experience on Linux/Windows:
     - Slicer: Use PrusaSlicer, available on Linux and Windows, which has a similar interface to Cura, the popular macOS slicer.
     - Monitor printer: OctoPrint is a popular choice for monitoring 3D printers over the web. You can run it in a container and access it via your remote desktop session.
5. **Persistence**:
   - To ensure persistent data across reboots and container restarts, use Docker volumes or bind mounts to store configuration files and other important data.
   - Alternatively, you can use Proxmox's built-in features like VM snapshots or use a separate storage node for persistent data.

Here's how to set up the Linux remote desktop environment using NoMachine:

1. Install NoMachine server on your Proxmox VE host:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomachine/debian/master/nxsstall.sh | bash -
```
2. Create a Docker container for PrusaSlicer and map the necessary ports (e.g., 80 for OctoPrint):
```bash
docker run -d --name slicer --network host -v /path/to/config:/config -p 80:80 prusa3d/prusa-slicer
```
3. Access the remote desktop session using the NoMachine client on your macOS, Linux, or Windows machine.
4. Once connected, run the OctoPrint container and configure PrusaSlicer as needed.

For Windows remoting, follow Microsoft's official guide for setting up Remote Desktop Services: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/roles/remote-desktop-services-install

By using this setup, you'll have a centralized remote desktop environment for managing your 3D printing workflows on Proxmox VE, with persistent data and a Mac-like software experience where possible.
