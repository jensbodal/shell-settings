â ™ For managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, I'd recommend considering the following containerized remote desktop environments on Proxmox:

1. **MacStadium**: MacStadium is a cloud-based platform that provides macOS-based virtual machines (VMs) with a focus on developer and workflow management. You can run multiple VMs from a single physical machine, each with its own dedicated IP address. This makes it ideal for centralizing workflows without syncing configurations between machines.
2. **Parallels Remote Desktop**: Parallels offers a remote desktop solution that allows you to access virtual machines running macOS or Linux on a Proxmox server. You can create multiple sessions from the same physical machine, each with its own configured workflow.
3. **VMware Horizon Workspace**: VMware Horizon Workspace provides a cloud-based platform for managing virtual desktops and applications. While not specifically designed for 3D printing workflows, it can be adapted to manage various types of persistent configurations.

All three options are suitable for Proxmox, but I'd recommend considering MacStadium as the top choice due to its:

* Native macOS support
* Cloud-based platform with seamless scalability and management
* Focus on developer and workflow management
* Ability to run multiple VMs from a single physical machine

Here's a brief overview of each option's pros and cons:

**MacStadium**

Pros:

* Native macOS support for optimal performance
* Scalable and managed cloud platform
* Seamless integration with Proxmox

Cons:

* Requires subscription-based model
* Limited customization options compared to other solutions

**Parallels Remote Desktop**

Pros:

* Easy to set up and manage on-premises or in the cloud
* Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows virtual machines
* Offers a range of configuration options

Cons:

* May require additional hardware resources for optimal performance
* Not as scalable as MacStadium's cloud-based platform

**VMware Horizon Workspace**

Pros:

* Scalable and managed platform with robust security features
* Supports multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)
* Integrates well with Proxmox

Cons:

* More complex setup process compared to Parallels Remote Desktop
* May require additional resources for optimal performance

Before making a final decision, consider the following factors:

1. Budget: Determine your budget for subscription-based models or hardware costs.
2. Performance requirements: Assess your specific performance needs and optimize resource allocation accordingly.
3. Customization options: Evaluate the level of customization required for your 3D printing slicer configuration workflow.
4. Scalability: Consider how easily you can scale up or down to accommodate changing workloads.

Ultimately, MacStadium's native macOS support, cloud-based platform, and focus on developer and workflow management make it an attractive choice for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration.
