Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to use on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows, specifically things like 3D printing slicer configurations. The user prefers macOS but also accepts Linux or Windows. They want to avoid syncing between machines by centralizing the workflow locally.

First, I need to understand what containerization means here. Containers are lightweight and portable, so they can be moved around without affecting the host system. Proxmox is a Debian-based open-source hypervisor, which means it's good for running containers efficiently.

The user wants persistent workflows, which implies that data and configurations shouldn't disappear when the container stops or if the machine restarts. So, using local storage within the container is crucial. Maybe using a volume to mount persistent data so that files aren't lost.

They mentioned 3D printing slicer configuration, which likely involves some computationally intensive tasks. The environment needs to handle that, so choosing a container OS that's optimized for such tasks would be important. Maybe something like Ubuntu, which is known for good performance on Proxmox.

The user wants macOS preferred but is okay with Linux or Windows. So, I should consider if it's possible to run macOS in containers on Proxmox. I know that Proxmox supports various container images, including Debian, Ubuntu, Windows, and even some enterprise ones. But macOS might be tricky because Apple has restrictive hardware requirements for its OS.

So, perhaps using a virtual machine instead of a container would be better if running macOS is the priority. However, the user specifically mentioned containers, so maybe there's a way to run a macOS container on Proxmox. I should check if there are existing images or if it's feasible through virtualization.

If running macOS in a container isn't possible, then using Linux or Windows containers would be the next step. For Linux, Ubuntu or Debian might be good choices because they have strong support on Proxmox and offer good performance for applications like 3D printing slicers.

For persistence, I can use bind mounts to attach local directories on the host machine to the container's file system. This way, any changes made inside the container are reflected in the mounted directory, keeping configurations centralized without needing to sync across machines.

I should also think about resource management. The 3D printing slicer might need good CPU and GPU performance. Proxmox can allocate resources to containers effectively, so assigning ample vCPUs and vGPUs would be necessary for smooth operation.

Monitoring and managing the container is another aspect. Tools like Portainer could help in managing containers, viewing logs, and automating tasks. Automating restarts or updates might also be beneficial to keep everything running smoothly without manual intervention.

So, putting this together: Use Proxmox's container capabilities with a suitable base OS (preferably Linux if macOS isn't possible). Ensure persistence through bind mounts for configuration files. Optimize resource allocation for performance. Use management tools like Portainer for ease of use.

If macOS in containers is not feasible, switch to a virtual machine approach, but the user seems set on containers. So, I'll focus on making the Linux container setup as robust and persistent as possible, perhaps using local storage or shared directories for configuration data.

To achieve your goal of setting up a centralized remote desktop environment with persistent workflows on Proxmox, particularly suitable for 3D printing slicer configurations, here's a structured approach:

1. **Containerization with Proxmox**:
   - Utilize Proxmox's container capabilities to run lightweight, portable environments.
   - Opt for Ubuntu or Debian as base OS images due to their strong performance on Proxmox and support for resource-intensive tasks.

2. **Persistence Through Bind Mounts**:
   - Use bind mounts to attach local directories on the host machine to the container's file system. This ensures that configurations and data remain centralized and persist even after container restarts.
   - Assign a dedicated directory, such as `/var/apps/slicer-config`, for persistent data.

3. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Allocate sufficient vCPUs and vGPUs within Proxmox to ensure the 3D printing slicer runs efficiently. This is crucial for handling computationally demanding tasks.
   - Use Proxmox's resource management features to optimize CPU and GPU allocation based on workload requirements.

4. **Container Management**:
   - Implement tools like Portainer or Prometheus for monitoring, logging, and automating container operations. These tools enhance the manageability of your containers and workflows.
   - Automate tasks such as restarting containers or updating software to reduce manual intervention.

5. **Considerations for macOS**:
   - Explore the feasibility of running a macOS container on Proxmox. While challenging due to Apple's hardware restrictions, it might be possible through virtualization or specific container images.
   - If macOS in containers isn't viable, consider using a virtual machine (VM) as an alternative.

By following this approach, you can centralize your workflow, avoid data synchronization across machines, and maintain efficient performance for tasks like 3D printing slicer configuration.
