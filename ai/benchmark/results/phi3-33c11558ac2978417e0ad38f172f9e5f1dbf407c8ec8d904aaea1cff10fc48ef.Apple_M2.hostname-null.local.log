⠙ ⠹ ⠸ The best containerized environment depends on your specific requirements and familiarity with various systems, as well as compatibility of software you wish to run within that workspace for managing tasks like configuring macOS-based slicers or other applications typically used during workflows in 3D printing. However, here's a suggestion based on general best practices:

**Containerd with Linux OS (like Ubuntu LTS) as the preferred host system due to wide software compatibility and better support for remote desktop protocols like VNC/RDP within containers. Consider using Parallels Desktop inside this container when necessary, or opting into a solution where you can run macOS directly in Docker if it's available – though less common.**

Here are the steps to set up such an environment on Proxmox:

1. **Install Container Engine (Containerd) on Host System:** Install Containerd for Ubuntu LTS or another supported Linux distribution which you prefer as your base OS in a virtual machine within Proxmox, since direct containerization of macOS is not commonly recommended due to licensin and compatibility issues with most containers.
   
2. **Install Docker Engine (for Windows/macOS):** If using docker on either Windows or Mac for this purpose would be preferable: Install the native Docker engine which will serve as your base container environment, ensuring macOS applications like slicers can run smoothly within a virtual machine context if needed by installing VMware Workstation Player and then setting up guest Linux distributions.
   
3. **Install Parallels Desktop (for Windows users)**: If you need to work with macOS-based workflows on your host system, consider using Parallels for containerized access within a Mac or another OS via SSH tunnels if needed because it's less common but possible due to their support of VMware Fusion.
   
4. **Install XRDP/VNC Server:** Inside the containers (Linux environments), install xrdp, remmina for Windows with RDP integration, or a VNC server that can connect through SSH tunnels if you're working on macOS via Parallels Desktop containerized VMs running inside Linux.
   
5. **Configure Remote Desktop Access:** Configure xrdp (Linux) and remmina/RDP client settings within the host system for access to containers, or use SSH tunneling from your local machine over a secure connection like OpenSSH directly into containerized Proxmox VMs if operating on Windows.
   
6. **Set up Workflow Automation:** Utilize workflow automation tools that can run commands inside the Linux-based remote desktop to manage persistent configurations for 3D printer slicing software or other tasks, avoiding sync issues by keeping configuration files in containerized environments and using scripts like Ansible, Puppet, Chef (if compatible with your Proxmox VMs), or custom shell script workflow.
   
7. **Persistent Data Management:** Ensure that the containers' data storage volumes are correctly configured for persistent data management across sessions by creating bind mounts between host and container directories where configuration files will reside, ensuring they remain in sync without needing to manually copy them back after each session/workflow completion.
   
8. **Automate SSH Tunneling:** If using remote desktop protocol like VNC over an SSH tunnel, consider automating this process with a script that sets up the necessary tunnels on boot and tear down upon shutdown for simplicity of workflow management across sessions without syncing configurations between machines unintentionally.
   
9. **Security Considerations:** Since you are running desktop environments remotely via containers, ensure your Proxmox VMs are secured with proper firewall rules, user permissions, and possibly encryption (like VPN or SSH) to protect sensitive workflow data during transfer over the network if necessary due to confidentiality concerns.
   
10. **Continuous Integration/Delivery Setup:** If your 3D printing slicer setup is part of a CI/CD pipeline, consider using services like Jenkins or GitLab Runner running inside containerized VMs for automating the build and deployment process directly within Proxmox' environment.
   
This configuration will ensure that you can manage persistent workflow configurations across different sessions without needing to sync between machines manually while maintaining a strong security posture, as well as being able to switch easily if needed from Linux/macOS based systems for macOS-specific applications or directly on Mac OS where necessary. The setup is flexible and allows the use of common remote desktop protocols within Proxmox VMs via containers ensuring you stay in control without syncing concerns, using persistent storage volumes instead to maintain configurations as needed across different sessions. Always remember that running macOS inside Linux virtual machines might be complex due to licensing restrictions (you need a Mac OS license for each instance), so make sure your workflow accommodates this requirement if it's mandatory.

Remember, the most important aspect is security and proper data management; always keep sensitive information within secure containers with appropriate access controls in place when working across multiple devices or networks to avoid sync issues by accidental sharing of configurations between machines.
