⠙ ⠹ ⠸ When looking into containerized remote desktop environments on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows such as configuring settings for a 3D printer slicer, with an emphasis on macOS but also allowing compatibility with Linux and Windows systems, you have several options to consider. Here are some of the most popular choices:

1. **Vagrant** - Although not containerized per se, Vagrant is widely used in conjunction with VirtualBox for creating reproducible development environments. It's versatile but less suitable if your primary focus is containers and macOS support as it relies on virtual machines rather than actual containers which are more lightweight and isolated:

   - Proxmox supports Vagrant via plugins like the 'vboxfusion' driver, allowing you to create a VM within Proxmox. However, if your workflow is heavy in configuration with persistent changes needed frequently (like 3D printer slicer settings), then consider transitioning into container-based solutions for better efficiency and faster startups/shutdowns due to the shared nature of containers' resources:
   
   ```shell
   vagrant init proxmox # Initialize a Vagrantfile with Proxmox driver. Ensure you have 'vboxfusion' installed in your VM or use a Linux guest instead if macOS is not an option for this setup directly through Vagrant plugins on the Mac.
   ```
   
2. **Docker Desktop** - With Docker, specifically with Proxmox’s compatibility layer that allows it to run Windows containers via WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you can achieve a containerized environment where macOS is supported through Parallels or native Hyper-V on Mac:
   
   ```shellin shell
   # Start Docker Desktop with Proxmox compatibility layer enabled. This allows running Windows containers, but note that using WSL 2 for this purpose may not support all Linux applications smoothly due to differences in the kernel API and file systems between Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and native Linux environments:
   
   # Start Docker Desktop on macOS via Parallels or Hyper-V, then configure a Proxmox VM with WSL 2 driver. Ensure you have installed an appropriate version of the Ubuntu LTS edition that supports WSL 2 for this setup (e.g., Ubuntu Server Core).
   ```
   
3. **Microsoft Remote Desktop Services** - If Windows is a necessity, then consider using Proxmox with Hyper-V to run full Virtual Machines instead of containers:

   ```shellin shell
   # Create and start VMs on Proxmox that are set up for remote desktop access. This allows you to manage the machine from another OS (Linux/macOS):
   
   virt-install --name mywinvm \
               --memory 2048 \
               --vcpus 1 \
               --nic bridge=br0,model=virtio-net-pci \
               --boot uefi_ssh,hdimg="./mywinimage.qcow2" \
               proxmox:hq --answer mypassword # Replace with your desired settings and credentials accordingly.
   ```
   
4. **X2Go** - If you're looking for a more traditional remote desktop solution that might not be containerized but can work across different platforms (including macOS, Linux, Windows), X2Go is an option:

   ```shellin shell
   # Install the Proxmox client and set up your machine accordingly. Then use x2goserver command to connect from a desktop or laptop running on Mac OSX/Linux/Windows without VNC overhead of VMs for more responsive workflow accessibility with X2Go:
   
   proxmox manage --host=your-proxmox-server \
                -n myvm_name # Replace 'myvm_name' and server IP accordingly.
   ``` 

Before committing to a particular setup, consider the following points that are crucial for your use case: network latency (remote connections may introduce this), compatibility of macOS with container technologies via Docker on Mac/Windows through WSL2 or Parallels VMs running Hyper-V. You might also want to investigate if 3D printer slicer software you intend to manage has native support for containers, as some specialized applications can run better directly within a lightweight and consistent environment like Docker without the need of VNC/RDP intermediaries:

```shellin shell
# Check compatibility with containerization tools or if they offer direct Mac binaries. Some workflow management might even be simpler through dedicated macOS solutions that are built to work well in tandem environments, such as a cloud-based 3D modeling service integrated into your design pipeline for automation and efficiency:
   
# No specific Docker commands here but the concept is to use container compatibility layers where available. Consider also exploring direct Proxmox guest OS options or using dedicated macOS applications compatible with workflows like slicer configuration when containers are not an optimal solution due to tool support constraints, if any arise: 
```
Remember that you will need appropriate hardware and software prerequisites on both the local machine (for running Proxmox) and remote desktop environments. Some trial-and0 errors may happen along your setup journey as container technologies are still evolving in terms of support for legacy applications across different OS platforms like macOS, so expect some compatibility challenges that might require further research or reaching out to the community with specific questions:
