⠙ ⠹ ⠹ The best containerized remote desktop environment that can cater to your needs on Proxmox would likely be a combination of technologies tailored towards achieving high performance and compatibility with macOS, Linux or Windows workloads while maintaining centralization for workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. Here's how you could approach this setup:

**1. Setting Up Proxmox as the Foundation:**  
Firstly, ensure that your Proxmox VM is set up with enough resources (CPU, memory, and I/O capacity) for handling resource-intensive tasks such as 3D slicing workflows smoothly. You may need to allocate more CPU cores or RAM depending on the complexity of your workloads.

**2. Choosing a Suitable Desktop Environment:**  
Because macOS is preferred, I'd recommend using Parallels Desktop for Containerization (PDC), which allows you to run macOS within Linux containers and virtual machines while still providing accessibility through its remote desktop feature with excellent graphical performance. Alternatively, if compatibility issues arise or additional features are needed beyond PDC’s capabilities:

**a) Using Docker on a Proxmox VM running Ubuntu Server (Linux):**  
You can set up an environment using tools like X2Go and xpra to create high-performance remote desktop sessions. This way, you'd run your macOS container inside the Linux machine that is managed by Proxmox:

1. Install Docker on a Ubuntu server VM running in Proxmox with enough resources for 3D slicing tasks (probably need more than just CPU and RAM but consider network bandwidth as well).
2. Create an XFCE or similar lightweight desktop environment that is known to work efficiently inside containers, like using Dockerfiles customized by community contributors who aim specifically at resource-intensive applications such as slicers: https://hub.docker.com/r/mariuskotta/3dprinting
3. Use `xpra` and X2Go client tools to establish a remote graphical session that can run on top of Docker containers within your Ubuntu VM hosted in Proxmox, allowing you to interact with the macOS environment seamlessly through SSH tunneling or VPN if needed for secure access.
4. Install necessary 3D printing slicer software directly into this container (for example, Cura) and ensure all workflows are stored within shared volumes that both your main Proxmox host and the macOS-based containers can access to keep configurations synchronized in a central location without syncing between machines—essentially using NFS or SSH file sharing.
5. Keep backups of important data on persistent storage such as AWS S3, Google Drive with version control capabilities like rsync for incremental backups if needed and replication across different regions to avoid losing your slicer configurations due to unforeseen circumstances (e.g., VM crashes or misconfigurations).

**b) Using Windows Server on Proxmox: Remote Desktop Gateway Approach with Mac Access via Crossover Thin Client Solution & SSH Tunneling/VPN:**  
If you need full access to macOS, another alternative is using a physical or virtual thin client running the Microsoft Terminal Emulator app that connects over SSH. Your Proxmox VM hosting Windows Server can manage this setup and provide all necessary commands for 3D slicer operations via CMD/PowerShell:

1. Set up your Windows server in Proxmox with a high-performance Desktop experience, installing software like MacOSXServer or macOS on HyperV if needed (however, note that running true macOS containers is not possible natively and may require alternative solutions).
2. Install CMD/PowerShell accessibility for your thin client setup as well so you can manage 3D slicer configurations from the Windows server itself without needing to run it directly on Proxmox VMs, using SSH tunneling or a secure VPN connection if needed to connect back to macOS.
3. Use shared volumes and consistent file management practices for persistent workflow storage across all systems involved in this setup (Windows Server Host + Mac access via thin clients). Consider additional tools like Git LFS for handling large 3D model files more effectively within version control repositories when working with configurations from different machines, ensuring a non-blocking central repository to avoid conflicts.
4. Use Azure DevOps or GitHub as your project management system and source code manager (with GIT), where all slicer configuration scripts are stored along with any other workflow script that manages the 3D printing process chain on Proxmox, using a shared continuous integration pipeline setup for automated testing/validation of configurations before applying them to real-world scenarios.
5. Employ monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana (installed within your Windows Server or macOS VMs) along with alerting mechanisms via Alertmanager configured into the same infrastructure, ensuring health checks on all components are performed regularly for proactive maintenance of workflow continuity without needing to sync configurations between machines—essentially providing you a centralized monitoring dashboard that oversees your entire setup's performance and status.

In both approaches (a) & (b), ensure proper networking setups, security measures such as SSH key pairs or multi-factor authentication for remote access are in place to safeguard against unauthorized entry while maintaining seamless interaction between the various components of your workflows on Proxmox. Also consider having disaster recovery and redundancy plans using snapshots (Proxmox backups) along with regular manual checkpoints for additional peace of mind regarding persistent configurations in a distributed setup like this one, ensuring that even if something goes wrong locally or remotely, you have minimal data loss potential.
