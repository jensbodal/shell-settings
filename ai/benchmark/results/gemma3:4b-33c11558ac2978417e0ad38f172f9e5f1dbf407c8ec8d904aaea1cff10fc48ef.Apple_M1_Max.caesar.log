⠙ Okay, this is a really solid use case for containerized remote desktop environments! Centralizing workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations is a fantastic approach to avoid drift and ensure consistency. Let's break down the best options for running on Proxmox, considering your needs:

**Top Recommendations:**

1. **X2Go:** (Highly Recommended – Excellent for 3D Printing)
   * **Why it's great:** X2Go is *specifically* designed for remote desktop applications and is renowned for its performance, especially over slower networks. It's built around a tiled, session-based approach.  This is crucial for 3D printing where you often need to view multiple windows simultaneously (slicer, preview, etc.).
   * **Containerization:** X2Go has excellent containerization support. You can easily run it as a Docker container on Proxmox.
   * **macOS Support:** Works brilliantly with macOS. It's a popular choice for macOS users wanting to access Windows or Linux applications.
   * **Performance:** X2Go utilizes a lightweight protocol that’s very efficient for remote display.
   * **Cost:** Free and open-source.
   * **Workflow Integration:**  Can be easily scripted (using things like Ansible or scripts) to automate actions *within* the remote session – for example, automatically loading a specific profile in your slicer.
   * **Example Docker Compose:**
     ```yaml
     version: "3.8"
     services:
       x2go:
         image: x2go/x2go
         ports:
           - "5900:5900"
           - "5901:5901"
         volumes:
           - /path/to/x2go/config:/config
         restart: unless-stopped
     ```


2. **Remmina:** (Good Option – Very Flexible)
   * **Why it's good:** Remmina is a powerful, open-source remote desktop client for Linux. It supports a vast number of protocols (RDP, VNC, X2Go, NX, SSHX, etc.).
   * **Containerization:**  You can containerize Remmina, though it's a bit less optimized than X2Go for remote display.
   * **macOS/Linux:** Works well on both macOS and Linux.
   * **Flexibility:** The huge protocol support means you can connect to *any* remote desktop environment you choose.
   * **Cost:** Free and open-source.
   * **Considerations:**  For 3D printing, X2Go will likely provide a smoother, more responsive experience.

3. **TigerVNC (with Docker):** (Decent, but Requires More Setup)
   * **Why it's viable:** TigerVNC is a popular VNC server.  You can run it in a Docker container.
   * **macOS/Linux:** Works well.
   * **Cost:** Free and open-source.
   * **Considerations:** VNC can be less performant than X2Go, especially over higher-latency networks.  It’s also less intuitive for managing multiple windows simultaneously.


**Why these choices are good for your workflow:**

* **Centralized Configuration:** Running the remote desktop environment in a container on Proxmox provides a single point of configuration. You manage your slicer settings within the container, and they'll be consistent across all sessions.
* **Persistent Workflows:** Because the session is stored in the container, you can easily resume your work after a reboot.
* **Automation:** You can use scripting (Bash, Python, etc.) to automate tasks within the container, automating the loading of profiles, running tests, and more.

**Here's a table summarizing the options:**

| Feature          | X2Go          | Remmina       | TigerVNC       |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Performance**    | Excellent      | Good          | Fair           |
| **Ease of Use**    | Very Good      | Good          | Moderate       |
| **macOS Support** | Excellent      | Good          | Good          |
| **Automation**     | Good           | Moderate      | Moderate      |
| **Containerization**| Excellent      | Good          | Good          |
| **Cost**           | Free           | Free          | Free           |


**Recommendations for your setup:**

1. **Start with X2Go:** It’s the most suitable for 3D printing workflows due to its performance.
2. **Docker:** Use Docker extensively to manage the containerized remote desktop environment.
3. **Proxmox Automation:** Leverage Proxmox's automation capabilities to manage the container deployment and scaling.

To help me narrow down the best recommendation for you, could you tell me:

*   **What operating system are you primarily using for the 3D printing side?** (macOS, Linux, Windows?)
*   **What is your network latency like?** (e.g., are you connecting over Wi-Fi or a wired connection?  What's the typical ping to the Proxmox server?)
*   **What level of scripting experience do you have?** (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced).
