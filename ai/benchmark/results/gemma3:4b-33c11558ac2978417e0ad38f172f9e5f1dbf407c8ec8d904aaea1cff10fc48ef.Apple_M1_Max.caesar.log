⠙ Okay, let's break down the best containerized remote desktop environments for your Proxmox setup, specifically geared towards persistent 3D printing workflows like a slicer configuration centralizer. You’re aiming to avoid syncing across machines – excellent goal!

Here's a prioritized list, considering macOS preference, Linux/Windows options, and the need for persistent workflows:

**1. VNC with Docker Container (Highly Recommended - Versatile & Mature)**

* **Technology:** VNC (Virtual Network Computing) + Docker
* **Why it's great:** This is arguably the most straightforward and flexible solution for your needs.
* **Containerization:** You'll use a Docker image like `vnc/vnc-x11` or `deluan/vnc-server` to run a VNC server within a container. This isolates the VNC server, ensuring consistent behavior across your Proxmox hosts.
* **macOS, Linux, Windows:**  Works perfectly with all of these. You'll use a VNC client on your host machine to connect to the container.
* **Persistence:**  The key is to mount a shared volume from Proxmox into the container. This allows you to save and load your 3D printing profiles, slicer configurations, and settings directly within the container.  You'd essentially use the container as a persistent storage location.
* **Ease of Setup:** Relatively easy to set up.  Docker provides simple instructions.
* **Cost:** Free (Docker is open-source).
* **Resources:**
    * **Docker Hub VNC Images:** [https://hub.docker.com/r/vnc/vnc-x11/](https://hub.docker.com/r/vnc/vnc-x11/)
    * **Deluan VNC Server:** [https://hub.docker.com/r/deluan/vnc-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/deluan/vnc-server)

**2. Remmina with Docker Container (Excellent for Linux Users)**

* **Technology:** Remmina (an X11 forwarding client) + Docker
* **Why it's great:**  If you're primarily using Linux, Remmina is a fantastic, lightweight, and powerful X11 forwarding client.
* **Containerization:** You’d use a Docker image like `deluan/vnc-server` running a VNC server inside.
* **macOS:**  Requires an X server on your macOS machine (e.g., XQuartz) to act as the intermediary for X11 forwarding.
* **Linux/Windows:** Works seamlessly with Linux. Windows support is possible but a little less polished.
* **Persistence:** Like VNC, a shared volume is crucial for saving persistent configuration.
* **Cost:** Free
* **Resources:**
    * **Deluan VNC Server Docker Hub:** [https://hub.docker.com/r/deluan/vnc-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/deluan/vnc-server)


**3. TeamViewer (Dockerized - User Friendly, but with Considerations)**

* **Technology:** TeamViewer (Commercial) + Docker
* **Why it's great:** TeamViewer is widely known and has a good user interface. Dockerizing it simplifies deployment and management.
* **Containerization:**  There are TeamViewer Docker images available.
* **macOS, Linux, Windows:**  Works across all OS.
* **Persistence:**  Requires careful configuration and potentially using a shared volume to persist settings.  TeamViewer isn't inherently designed for this level of persistent storage.
* **Cost:** Free (for personal use), but commercial licenses are required for business use.
* **Resources:** [https://hub.docker.com/r/teamviewer/teamviewer](https://hub.docker.com/r/teamviewer/teamviewer) – (Be mindful of licensing!)

**4. NextDesk (Dockerized - Advanced, for a Desktop Experience)**

* **Technology:** NextDesk (Commercial) + Docker
* **Why it’s good:** This provides a full desktop experience *within* the container. This means you have a full graphical environment that you can configure.
* **macOS, Linux, Windows:** All supported.
* **Persistence:**  This is a core strength of NextDesk – it’s designed to handle persistent applications and data.
* **Cost:** Commercial license required.
* **Resources:** [https://hub.docker.com/r/nextdesk/nextdesk](https://hub.docker.com/r/nextdesk/nextdesk)



**Recommendations & Key Considerations:**

* **For Your Primary Use Case (3D Printing):** **VNC with Docker** or **Remmina with Docker** are the best starting points. They offer a good balance of simplicity, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.
* **Shared Volumes are *Essential*:** Without a shared volume, your configuration data will be lost when the container is stopped or removed. Proxmox makes this extremely easy.
* **Proxmox Configuration:**  When creating the container, you’ll mount the shared volume using Docker’s volume mounting feature.
* **Consider NextDesk if:**  You want a more polished desktop experience and are willing to pay for it.

**To help me narrow down the best recommendation for *you*, could you tell me:**

*   **What's your primary operating system for accessing the remote desktop?** (macOS, Linux, Windows?)
*   **What's your comfort level with command-line administration?** (Are you comfortable with Docker commands, or do you prefer a more graphical interface?)
*   **Are there any specific features you need beyond basic remote access?** (e.g., clipboard sharing, drag-and-drop functionality, screen recording?)
