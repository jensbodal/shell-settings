Okay, so I need to figure out the best containerized remote desktop environment to use on Proxmox. The user wants this for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration. They mentioned macOS preference but also said Linux or Windows is acceptable. The main goal is to avoid syncing configurations between machines by centralizing everything in a local remote desktop.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, containerization is the key here. Containers are great because they provide isolated environments with everything needed for an application to run. Proxmox supports containers through its container technology, so that's a good start.

Now, the user wants persistent workflows. That means any changes made in one session should be saved and available in another session without having to reconfigure everything each time. So whatever solution we come up with needs to handle data persistence effectively.

Looking at possible options: remote desktop environments like VNC or NoMachine could be candidates. But since they want a containerized approach, maybe integrating a remote desktop protocol into containers would be better. There's also something called RemDesk which I've heard about before; it's an open-source solution that runs in containers and supports multiple platforms.

Wait, the user mentioned macOS preference but Linux or Windows acceptable. So cross-compatibility is important. Maybe using a containerized macOS environment on Proxmox? But Proxmox itself is Linux-based. How easy is it to run macOS in a container there? I'm not sure, maybe using something like MacKit.

Alternatively, if running macOS containers isn't straightforward, perhaps using Linux containers with compatibility layers could work. Or maybe setting up Windows containers since Proxmox supports Docker, and then mapping the necessary applications across platforms.

The goal is to centralize the workflow in a local remote desktop, so each user should have access to their own centralized configuration. Maybe using encrypted volumes or some sort of persistent storage within the container that's tied to the user's account.

I also need to consider security aspects. Ensuring that data isn't synced between machines automatically and remains localized to each instance. So perhaps using read-only templates for configurations but allowing user-specific directories to persist.

Another thought: could use a combination of Docker and a remote desktop solution like RemDesk within Proxmox? That way, users can have their own containerized environment with persistent data stored locally on the Proxmox host.

Wait, maybe the user doesn't need a full remote desktop. Perhaps using a container as a workspace that's accessible via VNC or another protocol. They could mount their local storage into the container so any changes are saved there, making it persistent across sessions.

So putting it all together: use containerization (Docker) on Proxmox, set up a remote desktop environment within containers, ensure data persistence by mapping local storage to the container, and possibly using something like RemDesk for cross-platform support. This way, configurations aren't synced but are stored locally, meeting the user's requirements.

I should also think about how to handle different platforms—since macOS is preferred but others are acceptable. Maybe creating separate containers for each platform or having a base container that can switch between them based on user settings.

Another consideration: performance. Containers might be lightweight enough, especially if using Proxmox's container technology which is optimized. Also, ensuring that the remote desktop environment doesn't add too much overhead.

Wait, maybe instead of using multiple containers, have one container that can switch between macOS and other OSes depending on the user's session. That could centralize the workflow without needing separate containers for each OS.

But I'm not sure how feasible that is. It might be easier to manage separate containers for different OS environments, allowing users to choose which one they want to use based on their preferences.

In summary, the steps would involve:

1. Install and configure Proxmox with Docker.
2. Set up a containerized remote desktop environment (like RemDesk or another solution).
3. Ensure each user's configuration is stored in persistent volumes, maybe using encrypted local storage for security.
4. Configure applications within these containers to handle 3D printing slicer needs.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I need to make sure this approach avoids syncing configurations by keeping everything localized via persistent storage tied to individual users or their machines.

To achieve a centralized, containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox for managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker on Proxmox**: Ensure that Docker is installed and configured on your Proxmox host.

2. **Set Up Containerized Remote Desktop**:
   - Use **RemDesk**, an open-source remote desktop solution designed to run in containers.
   - Install RemDesk within a container, ensuring it supports cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows).

3. **Configure Persistent Storage**:
   - Utilize Docker volumes or directories to store user-specific configurations.
   - For macOS users, explore using **MacKit** to create macOS containers on Proxmox.
   - Consider encrypted local storage to maintain security and ensure data persistence.

4. **Handle Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - If running separate containers for each platform (macOS, Linux, Windows), manage them effectively within the same remote desktop environment.
   - Alternatively, set up a base container that can switch between platforms based on user preference or session type.

5. **Implement Remote Desktop Protocol**:
   - Integrate RemDesk or another suitable solution to enable remote access to these containers.
   - Ensure that each user has access to their own persistent data without automatic syncing across machines.

6. **Ensure Security and Performance**:
   - Use read-only templates for configurations while allowing user-specific directories to persist.
   - Monitor performance to ensure containerized environments remain lightweight and responsive.

By following these steps, you can centralize workflows, avoid configuration synchronization, and provide a secure, persistent remote desktop environment tailored to the user's needs.
