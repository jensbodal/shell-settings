⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠼ ⠴ ⠦ ⠧ ⠇ ⠏ ⠋ ⠙ To achieve a centralized and persistent workflow for tasks like 3D printer configuration on Proxmox, you can use containerized solutions that allow you to run a stable and consistent environment accessible remotely. Here are some options that fit your requirements:

### 1. **Ubuntu with Remmina or AnyDesk**
- **Containerization**: Use LXC (Linux Containers) in Proxmox to create an Ubuntu-based container.
- **Desktop Environment**: Install a lightweight desktop environment like XFCE or LXDE, which will run smoothly on low-resource containers.
- **Remote Desktop**: Set up a remote desktop server such as Remmina with RDP or VNC, or use AnyDesk for easier setup and performance. These solutions provide reliable access and can be configured to work well within containerized environments.

### 2. **Windows Container with RDP**
- **Containerization**: While Windows containers are less common in Proxmox due to licensing and resource needs, it is possible to run them if you have the necessary licenses.
- **Remote Desktop**: Use the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) within a containerized Windows environment. This setup will feel very similar to using a physical or virtual machine running Windows.

### 3. **macOS in a Parallels or UTM Virtual Machine**
- **Alternative Approach**: While direct containerization of macOS is not feasible, you can use Parallels Desktop or UTM with Proxmox for more robust macOS support. These solutions allow macOS to run as a virtual machine rather than a container.
- **Remote Access**: Use third-party tools like VNC or TeamViewer to access the macOS VM.

### 4. **Dockerized Linux with X2Go**
- **Containerization**: Docker is not natively supported for GUI applications in Proxmox, but you can use it as an intermediary layer within a container.
- **Desktop Environment**: Choose a lightweight desktop environment suitable for running inside Docker containers.
- **Remote Desktop**: Use X2Go or similar solutions to access the session. You'll need to configure port forwarding and ensure your Proxmox host's firewall settings allow the necessary traffic.

### Considerations:
- **Persistence**: Ensure that data persists by mounting volumes from the container filesystem to a location on the host system.
- **Networking**: Set up proper network configurations in Proxmox to route traffic for remote desktop access, ensuring security and accessibility.
- **Security**: Secure your remote desktop setup with strong passwords or SSH keys. Use VPNs or other secure methods to protect connections.

### Recommended Setup:
For a balance between ease of use, performance, and flexibility, consider using an Ubuntu-based LXC container with XFCE or LXDE, combined with AnyDesk for remote access. This approach provides good compatibility and performance within the Proxmox environment without requiring Windows licensing or macOS virtualization complexities. 

Remember to regularly back up your configurations and data to prevent loss in case of system issues.
