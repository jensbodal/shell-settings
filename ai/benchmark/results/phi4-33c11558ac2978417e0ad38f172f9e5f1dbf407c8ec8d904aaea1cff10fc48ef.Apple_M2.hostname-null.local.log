⠙ ⠹ ⠸ ⠼ ⠴ ⠦ ⠧ ⠇ ⠏ For running a containerized remote desktop environment on Proxmox that supports persistent workflows such as 3D printer slicing configuration, you have several options. Given your preference for macOS (but openness to Linux or Windows), let's explore some solutions:

### 1. **macOS with VNC**

- **Setup**: You can use a macOS VM in Proxmox and set up a VNC server on it.
- **Pros**: Native macOS experience; full access to macOS-specific applications like Cura for slicing.
- **Cons**: Requires a macOS license; might need additional configuration for performance optimization.

### 2. **Linux with X2Go or NoMachine**

#### **X2Go:**
- **Setup**: Install a Linux distribution in Proxmox and set up an XFCE desktop environment. Use X2Go as the remote desktop solution.
- **Pros**: Lightweight; supports SSH tunneling for secure connections; integrates well with various Linux distros.
- **Cons**: May not have all macOS-specific applications natively available.

#### **NoMachine:**
- **Setup**: Install NoMachine on a Linux VM in Proxmox.
- **Pros**: High performance and low latency; user-friendly interface; supports both Linux and Windows clients.
- **Cons**: Slightly more resource-intensive than VNC or X2Go.

### 3. **Windows with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or AnyDesk**

#### **Windows RDP:**
- **Setup**: Deploy a Windows Server VM in Proxmox and enable the built-in RDP server.
- **Pros**: Seamless experience on Windows; widely used and supported.
- **Cons**: Requires a Windows license.

#### **AnyDesk:**
- **Setup**: Install AnyDesk on a Windows or Linux VM.
- **Pros**: Easy setup; supports various platforms including macOS, Linux, and Windows clients.
- **Cons**: Commercial version required for advanced features.

### 4. **Using Docker Containers with Remote Desktop**

- **Tools**: Consider using containerized solutions like `dind-desktop` (Docker-in-Docker desktop) or similar projects that provide a GUI environment within Docker containers.
- **Pros**: Lightweight and isolated; easy to replicate environments.
- **Cons**: May require more setup for specific applications like slicing software.

### Recommendation

For a balance of performance, ease of use, and flexibility, using **NoMachine** on a Linux VM is a strong choice. It provides a good user experience across different platforms and can handle the graphical demands of 3D printing software efficiently.

If you prefer macOS specifically for its applications and workflow, setting up a macOS VM with a VNC server is ideal, provided you have the necessary licenses.

Ensure that whichever solution you choose, it supports persistent storage for your configurations. You might need to set up shared folders or network storage solutions in Proxmox to maintain configuration files across sessions.
