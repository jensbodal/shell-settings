⠙ ⠙ ⠸ ⠸ ⠴ ⠴ ⠧ ⠧ ⠏ ⠋ ⠋ ⠹ ⠸ ⠸ ⠴ ⠦ ⠦ ⠇ ⠏ ⠏ ⠙ ⠹ Okay, let's break down the best containerized remote desktop environments for your Proxmox setup, specifically geared toward managing persistent workflows like 3D printing slicer configurations. You're aiming for centralized management and avoiding configuration syncing – that's a smart move for efficiency.

Here’s a breakdown of the top contenders, considering your requirements:

**1. Xrdp + Docker Container (Most Recommended - Flexibility & Ease)**

* **What it is:** Xrdp is an open-source RDP server.  Running it in a Docker container gives you a clean, isolated environment and simplifies management.
* **Why it's good for you:**
    * **macOS Support:** Xrdp works seamlessly with macOS. You can run macOS containers and connect via RDP.
    * **Linux & Windows:** Works perfectly with Linux and Windows containers.
    * **Persistence:** Configurations remain within the container, eliminating the need for syncing.
    * **Centralized Management:** You manage the RDP server within the container, centralizing control.
    * **Lightweight:** Docker containers are efficient, minimizing resource usage on Proxmox.
* **How to set it up:**
    1. **Create a Dockerfile:**  A basic Dockerfile would install Xrdp and any necessary clients (e.g., macOS RDP client, Windows Remote Desktop Connection).
    2. **Run the Container:**  Use Docker commands to start the container, mapping ports to allow RDP connections.
    3. **Configure RDP:**  Set up user accounts and permissions within the container.
* **Resources:**
    * [Xrdp Docker Guide](https://docs. xrdp.org/doc/docker.html) - Excellent starting point.
    * [Docker Hub - Xrdp Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/xdp/)

**2. VNC + Docker Container (Solid Option - Mature, But Less Modern)**

* **What it is:** VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a long-standing remote desktop protocol.
* **Why it's good for you:**
    * **macOS Support:** VNC clients exist for macOS.
    * **Linux & Windows:** Excellent support across all operating systems.
    * **Persistence:** Similar to Xrdp, configurations are contained within the container.
* **Cons:**
    * **Security:** VNC historically has some security concerns if not properly configured (use SSH tunneling!).
    * **Performance:** Can be less responsive than Xrdp in some situations.
* **Resources:**
    * [Docker Hub - VNC Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/vnc/vnc-server/)


**3. NextDesk (Potentially Complex, Feature-Rich)**

* **What it is:** NextDesk is a remote desktop solution with a focus on productivity and workflow management.
* **Why it's good for you (Potentially):**
    * **macOS Support:** Yes.
    * **Centralized Workspaces:**  Designed for creating and managing shared workspaces.
* **Cons:**
    * **More Complex Setup:**  NextDesk can be more involved to configure than Xrdp or VNC.
    * **Cost:**  The professional versions have costs.
* **Resources:**
    * [NextDesk Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nextdesk/nextdesk)

**4. TigerVNC + Docker (Lightweight VNC)**

* **What it is:** TigerVNC is a lightweight VNC server implementation.
* **Why it's good for you:**
    * **Lightweight:** Ideal if you're resource-constrained.
    * **Persistence:**  Configurations remain within the container.
* **Cons:**
    * **Less Feature-Rich:**  The VNC client experience might be less polished than some other options.



**Recommendations Based on Your Needs:**

* **Best Overall (Recommended): Xrdp + Docker** -  The most robust, flexible, and generally easiest option to manage, with excellent macOS support and a modern RDP protocol.
* **If you prioritize simplicity and lightweight resource use: TigerVNC + Docker** - If you're very concerned about minimizing overhead.
* **If you need advanced workflow management features: NextDesk + Docker** -  But be prepared for a steeper learning curve.

**Key Considerations for Your 3D Printing Workflow:**

* **Slicer Software:**  Ensure the chosen remote desktop environment can handle the demands of your slicer software (e.g., rendering, large file transfers).
* **User Permissions:** Carefully configure user accounts and permissions within the containers to protect your 3D model data and configurations.
* **Storage:**  Consider where you'll store your 3D models – ideally within the container’s filesystem or a shared storage solution accessible to the container.
* **Proxmox Storage:** Leverage Proxmox’s storage features (LVM, ZFS) for optimal performance and data protection.

To help me narrow down the best recommendation for *you*, could you tell me:

*   **What slicer software are you using?** (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura, Simplify3D)
*   **What's your Proxmox host's resources like?** (CPU, RAM, Storage)
*   **How comfortable are you with configuring Docker and remote desktop protocols?** (Beginner, intermediate, advanced)
