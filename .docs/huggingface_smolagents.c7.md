TITLE: Share a Custom Tool to Hugging Face Hub
DESCRIPTION: This example shows how to publish a custom tool to the Hugging Face Hub using the `push_to_hub` method. It requires a pre-created repository on the Hub and a Hugging Face API token with write access. Tools must be self-contained with imports defined within functions to ensure proper serialization and sharing.

model = LiteLLMModel(
    model_id="ollama_chat/llama3.2", # This model is a bit weak for agentic behaviours though
    api_base="http://localhost:11434", # replace with 127.0.0.1:11434 or remote open-ai compatible server if necessary
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", # replace with API key if necessary
    num_ctx=8192 # ollama default is 2048 which will fail horribly. 8192 works for easy tasks, more is better. Check https://huggingface.co/spaces/NyxKrage/LLM-Model-VRAM-Calculator to calculate how much VRAM this will need for the selected model.

TITLE: Define Helium Instructions String for Agent
DESCRIPTION: Assigns a multi-line string containing detailed instructions and embedded code examples for using Helium to a Python variable, which is then passed to the agent for context.
SOURCE: https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/docs/source/en/examples/web_browser.md#_snippet_6

LANGUAGE: python
CODE:
```
helium_instructions = """
You can use helium to access websites. Don't bother about the helium driver, it's already managed.
We've already ran "from helium import *"
Then you can go to pages!
Code:
```py
go_to('github.com/trending')
```<end_code>

You can directly click clickable elements by inputting the text that appears on them.
Code:
```py
click("Top products")
```<end_code>

If it's a link:
Code:
```py
click(Link("Top products"))
```<end_code>

If you try to interact with an element and it's not found, you'll get a LookupError.
In general stop your action after each button click to see what happens on your screenshot.
Never try to login in a page.

To scroll up or down, use scroll_down or scroll_up with as an argument the number of pixels to scroll from.
Code:
```py
scroll_down(num_pixels=1200) # This will scroll one viewport down
```<end_code>

When you have pop-ups with a cross icon to close, don't try to click the close icon by finding its element or targeting an 'X' element (this most often fails).
Just use your built-in tool `close_popups` to close them:
Code:
```py
close_popups()
```<end_code>

You can use .exists() to check for the existence of an element. For example:
Code:
```py
if Text('Accept cookies?').exists():
    click('I accept')
```<end_code>
"""
```
