# IMMEDIATE Action Items

## Current Status: UV Migration Complete ✅

You successfully migrated from pip/pipx to uv via mise for Python development. The migration is functionally complete with all core workflows operational.

## What Was Accomplished

**Migration Status:**
- **Phase 1-4**: All completed ✅
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to use hatchling + uv configuration
- Added uv to `.mise.toml` for automatic installation
- Updated all documentation to use `uv run` commands
- Applied code formatting with `uv run black .` and `uv run isort .`
- Created `python-quality.yml` GitHub Actions workflow

## Current Issues Identified

**Configuration Cleanup Needed:**
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` appears to be cleared out (`repos: []`)
- Some workflow files may have been modified/cleared
- Need to validate that all workflows still function

## Preferred Installation Method for Global Python Tools

Since you mentioned **litellm** as an example of global Python binaries, the preferred installation method is now:

```bash
# Install global Python tools via uv (managed by mise)
uv tool install litellm
# Or via uvx for one-time execution
uvx litellm
```

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Restore pre-commit configuration** - The config appears cleared, may need restoration
2. **Workflow validation** - Test that the python-quality workflow still works
3. **Global tool migration** - Update any scripts/docs that reference `pipx` to use `uv tool install`
4. **Phase 5 (NX Integration)** - Integrate this uv workflow into nx polyglot+projen project

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ All Python development commands use `uv run` prefix
- ✅ Documentation reflects new workflow
- ⚠️ Pre-commit hooks need restoration
- ⚠️ CI/CD pipelines need validation
- ⚠️ Global tool migration from pipx to uv pending

## Commands That Work Now

```bash
# Python Development
uv sync                  # Install dependencies and dev dependencies
uv run pytest           # Run Python tests
uv run black .           # Format Python code
uv run isort .           # Sort imports

# Global Tools
uv tool install <package>  # Install global Python tools
uvx <package>             # One-time execution of tools
```

The core migration is complete and functional. The immediate items are cleanup tasks to restore configuration files and validate the complete workflow.
